TITLE: MEI/DEPLOYMENT ONE/SO YOU LIKE FISH
      
BG: Overwatch HQ (same as intro)
      
N: You lower the pad and hand it back to the Commander, watching his face intently. Why do they want an oceanographer? What possible use could your knowledge be to the almighty Overwatch?

His face doesn't change as he looks over your information.

J: So you like... fish?

N: You don't know what to make of this question. You suppose you like fish, but there are many different kinds, and some are definitely worse than others.

P: I mean, it depends on the fish. I like cuttlefish, but flounder kind of freak me out. And clownfish are on a whole other level.

He just stares at you. 

{i}Oh no, I said something wrong.{i}

Maybe he doesn't like fish. Maybe they didn't need an oceanographer anyway, and they called in the wrong person. {i}"Sorry, sorry, wrong number. We'll send you on your way now."{i}

He smirks. This is it. You're about to get the boot. Or... {w=0.25}do they even let people leave here alive? Maybe you already know too much. Maybe this is the end of the road for you.

J: I'm quite fond of beer battered.

N: Oh. {i}Oh{/i}. He chuckles and taps something on the infopad, letting you struggle with your embarrassment in relative privacy for a second or two.

J: You'll be assigned to Agent Frostbite in Environmental Monitoring at our Watchpoint in Antarctica. Hope you packed warm. If not, grab a coat at the commissary. 

N: He considers for a moment.

J: Might want two coats.

N: {i}Antarctica{/i}. {w=0.1}It's already cold enough up here, and they're sending you somewhere even {i}colder{/i}. An involuntary shiver runs down your spine.

J: Environmental Monitoring is our division dedicated to, well, monitoring the environment. They're tasked to stop and, if possible, reverse damage caused to vulnerable ecosystems.

This planet is our home, and we at Overwatch intend on keeping it in one piece for future generations.

N: His words echo the thoughts that get you up in the morning. You feel a spark within you.

P: Sir, I agree! I'm honoured to be placed on this team.

N: For the first time, he looks at you with what could almost be pride. You feel a warmth in your chest, and a determination to not let the Commander down.

He {i}hmm{/i}s for a moment.

J: I'm going to send you straight to the hangar. You're going to want to head out immediately for this -- it's no small deal. I'll get Agent Frostbite to meet you there.

Oh, and...

N: He smirks again.

J: Watch out for Frostbite. She can be... {w=0.1}icy.

N: Oh no. Your first day, and already you've got a job that is {i}no small deal{i}. You're by no means bad at what you do, but they're entrusting you with a great deal of responsibility already.

And a mean boss! What if you screw up? Will this Agent Frostbite just leave you in the icy plains of Antarctica as punishment? 

You shiver again, and not from the cold.

P: Thank...

N: You gulp.

P: Thank you, sir. I'll be on my way.

J: Dismissed. 

N: You salute -- though you're not sure if this is the right time -- and turn on your heels to head back to the hangar. 

Thankfully, you kind of know the route now, and you don't find as many dead ends this time. You pull your coat tighter, and try to not feel anxious about meeting this Agent Frostbite.

TITLE: MEI/DEPLOYMENT ONE/HOPE YOU PACKED WARM

BG: Overwatch hangar (??) && Aircraft interior??

<<bg>> OVERWATCH HANGAR
      
N: The hangar is exactly the same as you left it: cold and mostly empty, a few Overwatch members running to-and-fro with purpose. Some of them are loading the transport you arrived on with scientific equipment you mostly don't recognize. 

As you wait, your mind begins to wander. What food will there be to eat in Antarctica? Fish, maybe. Will Agent Frostbite expect you to eat polar bear?

Wait. {w=0.1}Polar bears aren't even {i}in{/i} Antarctica. Some scientist you are. 

You mentally kick yourself, just as a woman swathed in thick furs strides into the hangar.<meidefault> {w=0.1}Her arms are filled with equipment that looks far more expensive than any paycheck you've ever earned. 

By the way the other Overwatch agents defer to her, you realise this must be Agent Frostbite. {w=0.1}You instantly step towards her to offer help.

P: E-excuse me --

N: At the sound of your voice, Agent Frostbite turns in your direction. You freeze in your steps as she looks you over, waiting for her to deem you unworthy.

P: I'm the new recruit assigned to you, m-ma'am. 

N: You inwardly cringe at your stammering. Surely she will sense your weakness and pounce. 

Her eyes are hidden behind the glare of light across her glasses, but you imagine they're as cold as the air in the hangar.

P: I don't want to assume... but would you like any help carrying anything?

Uh -- Ma'am. Sir. Ma'am.

N: You salute again, then quickly drop your hand and wait for judgment.

Agent Frostbite tilts her head...{w=0.1} and her glasses clear, revealing eyes as warm as the coffee you wish you had in your hands right now.

She breaks into a wide grin.

A: Ah! You are the one helping me! It's good to meet you -- {$playername} is it? I am Mei-Ling Zhou, but you can call me Mei.

M: Oh, but you're trembling! Are you cold? Or...

N: She laughs, and it is one of the cutest sounds you have ever heard. How can someone so cruel sound so sweet? 

M: Did the Commander tell you stories about me? 

N: You nod.

P: Yes, he said you could be, uh, icy?

N: Mei shakes her head, and the pile of electronics in her arms wobbles dangerously.

M: They are all lies. He likes to mess with newbies, like you. I'm nothing like he says, unless he has told you I'm... {w=0.1}a-Mei-zing! 

<meihappy> N: She laughs to herself, and you can't help but chuckle along. 

Word play isn't so bad, you're prone to making a joke or two -- or ten -- yourself sometimes. Your old colleagues once locked you in a lab for it. You never learned. 

<meidefault> M: If you would like to help, you could load these into the transport for me?

N: Mei nods her head to gesture at her load.

You hold out your own arms and she unloads the equipment into them with great care.

Your arms drop and your knees bend under the weight instantly. It's all you can do to stop yourself from dropping everything. What on earth is this stuff made of?

M: Are you okay? It's a bit heavy, sorry!

N: You feel your muscles trembling with the strain. You have no clue how you'll make it across the hangar to the transport without your limbs falling right off.

But you started this, and you'll finish it if it kills you. {w=0.1}You paste the fakest smile possible on and speak through gritted teeth. 

P: Yeah, I'm fine.

M: Thank you so much. I left Snowball in the lab. Silly me! 

P: Snowball?

M: Yes, my little assistant! They're very expressive.

I'll be back soon. Thank you for the help, {$PlayerName}!

N: Mei bounces back the way she came, filled with boundless energy and enthusiasm.

{i}... just how strong is that woman?{/i}

Taking a deep breath, you try to judge the distance to the transport from where you stand. The verdict: it's pretty damn far. Might as well be another country at this rate.

{i}Take it one step at a time. One step... after the other... {/i}

Taking small, shuffling steps, you somehow make it to the transport ramp without collapsing. You feel eyes on you, and so you try to keep up your strong facade.

<<bg>> AIRCRAFT INTERIOR
      
As soon as you've secured the equipment, you throw yourself into a seat and let your arms hang limp beside you. You're resigned to the knowledge they'll probably never work again.

At least you didn't drop anything. There's a first time for everything. 

M: Hello again!

N: You look up to see Mei entering the aircraft, a small pod-like robot strapped to her back. Too exhausted to reply, you give her a nod. 

Though the exercise warmed you, you know you'll be feeling the chill again soon. You envy Mei and her big, warm-looking clothes. Especially her furred hood.

She spends a few moments checking over the electronics, then as the transport starts up with a deep thrumming, she sits in the seat beside you and straps herself in.

T [unseen, over an intercom]: {i}Hope you're all buckled up and ready to go back there. Could get a little bumpy.{/i}

N: You quickly follow Mei's lead and strap into your harness. The last thing you want is to go flying across the aircraft's interior... {w=0.25}again. Don't want to embarrass yourself in front of Mei on your first day. 

Hopefully you'll at last three days before that. {w=0.1}Or at least two. {w=01}Just one hour would be nice, really.

You shake off the memories of your trip to Overwatch HQ and your anxieties about looking Super Cool enough to be an agent, and settle into your seat for what you know will be a long ride. 

The aircraft lifts off with a light jolt, and then you're away. Off on an adventure, and your first, Serious Business Overwatch mission. Something so vital, you apparently didn't even have time to be briefed before leaving.

After all, you {i}just{/i} got here. And you're already leaving again. {w=0.25}Your stomach rumbles. 

{i}Didn't we at least have time for lunch...?{/i}

To distract yourself from your grumblies, you inspect your surroundings. The inside of the transport isn't very exciting, and all you can see through the small windows is white -- whether clouds or snow, it's impossible to tell. 

<meiworried> Mei has her eyes on an infopad she has resting on her knee. She chews on her lower lip, her eyebrows furrowed. She blinks, then seems to notice your less-than-subtle gaze and turns to look at you.

<meihappyblush>M: Oh! I'm sorry, I forgot you were here! 

N: She smiles apologetically. As you consider just how forgettable you may well be, she begins to search her coat's overlarge pockets. <meidefault>Probably searching for a super-important climate device.

M: Hmm...

N: As you watch, she pulls a veritable plethora of protein bars from her pockets and dumps them on top of her infopad in her lap. Caramel, chocolate, raspberry... 

Your stomach growls again. 

M: It's a long way to Antarctica. I thought we might get hungry. 

N: She hands you some of the protein bars, and you could honestly marry her right here on this aircraft. Instead, you tear away the wrapper from a chocolate flavoured bar and chomp right into it.

It's dense, but the rich chocolate flavour floods your mouth. The hungry monster that is your stomach seems to retreat, appeased for the time being by this sweet offering.

P: My parents used to tell me, "You can't save the world on an empty stomach!"

<meihappyblush> N: Mei laughs, but then... <meiworried>her demeanour turns serious, as if a heavy cloud has settled over her head. 

M: Yes, saving the world. That is what we're going to do. I hope.

P: You hope?

M: Penguins have been moving inland in Antarctica in massive numbers. I'm worried it's a sign of an ecological disaster about to happen -- animals are very intuitive. They sense things we can't.

<meidefault>Maybe it's nothing after all, but if it is something and I ignore it -- well, I'm not ignoring it. {w=0.1}Plus, we get to see penguins!

P: That's a peng-win if you ask me.

N: Mei breaks out into a massive grin at your joke. Finally, someone who appreciates the finer subtleties of good humour.

<meihappy> M: Ha! I would agree. 

<meidefault>But first: I have a question for you, {$PlayerName}.

N: Oh no, a {i}question{/i}. What kind of test is she springing? Perhaps this bubbly Mei has just been a facade all along, and Agent Frostbite is waiting for the perfect moment to eject you from the aircraft.

You straighten your shoulders, determined to prove yourself.

P: Shoot.

M: Why did you become an oceanographer?

N: The question hangs in the air between you and Mei as you consider it. This seems less a test of your abilities, but more of your character. 

Or maybe you're just overthinking it, like usual.

{i}Why {/i}did{i} I become an oceanographer...?{/i}

      ///CONSEQUENTIAL CHOICE///
      
FIRST CHOICE <approval +1>: I wanted to make a difference.
SECOND CHOICE <neutral>: Fish are pretty cool.
THIRD CHOICE <neutral>: It seemed the right path to take.

      ///FIRST CHOICE///
      
P: I was raised to believe in helping the world in any way I could, and I've always loved the ocean. I thought that I could combine those two parts of me, so I followed my heart.

Turns out it was something I was good at and enjoyed and, long story short, here I am.

M: Yes! I totally understand this. I've always loved the world and the animals that live here. When I was growing up, global warming was destroying the planet and that scared me, even when I was so young. 

I thought becoming a climatologist would give me a chance to help, because our climate is so important. I was always good at science -- I invented so many things that almost worked. I drove my mother up the wall with my inventions!

<meihappy>Now I get to work with Overwatch, and meet so many new people -- and cute animals. Plus, my inventions work at least 95% of the time now. Who would have thought I could be so lucky?

N: She positively beams, glowing with enthusiasm. If all of Overwatch are like this, it must be a formidable force indeed. And somehow, they think you're worth joining them. {w=0.25}Well, if they think so, it must be true.

You wonder if you look like that when you talk about the ocean, with such a light in your eyes. Too bad you'll never get a chance to... {w=0.1}sea it for yourself.

...

{i}Why am I like this?{/i}

M: I may be worried about what we're going to find, but I'm excited to work with you. If only for your jokes.

N: I'll do my best! And I promise I won't peng-wing it -- most of the time.

N: She bursts into laughter, and the sound rings through the aircraft's interior. Reaching over, she pats your shoulder with more strength than you'd expect.

M: I'm sure you'll do fine.

      ///SECOND CHOICE///
      
P: I just really think fish are neat.

<meisurprise> N: Mei blinks at you, seemingly surprised by your reply. Maybe she doesn't like fish.

P: You know -- and whales and dolphins too. All sea creatures. They're all neat.

M: They're...{w=0.1} neat?

<meidefault> N: She shakes her head, her dark hair shining in the white light streaming in through the windows. She's probably regretting her choice in bringing you along -- though, you suppose it wasn't much of a choice.

P: Yeah. When I was a kid, my parents would take me to the aquarium. I would spend hours just watching the fish drift around. It looked so peaceful in there.

N: Thinking back to the way you stared through those glass walls into another world fills you with that same sense of peace you felt as a child. You can't help but smile.

<meihappy> M: That sounds lovely! I haven't been to nearly enough aquariums in my life. Maybe I'll go next time I get shore leave.

P: I could show you the one I used to go to --

N: You cut your sentence off, worried of sounding too forward or familiar. You've never had the easiest time reading other people, perhaps why you've often found refuge in aquariums.

M: ... {w=0.1}I think I'd like that. 

M: But, first we need to save the world, so that all the {i}neat{/i} animals can be safe and happy.

N: Mei grins, cheeks flushed with a soft pink. You get the impression she's thinking about all those animals, like the penguins you're travelling across the world to observe. You hope you'll see whales.

      ///THIRD CHOICE///
      
P: I grew up with parents working in the United Nations, so I got it drilled into me that I should do something that would make a difference. They seemed to want me to go into something like oceanography, so I did.

M: So it's just a job to you?

N: Something in her tone makes you think she's definitely judging you.

P: I guess... {w=0.1}But I like the ocean.

M: What about the climate? And the planet? Isn't that important to you?

N: Her eyebrows knit together as she looks you right in the eyes, and you know that despite her sweet exterior, she's filled with a fierce and determined fire. Beside her, you feel inadequate; a candle next to a bonfire. 

P: Yeah -- yeah, of course! Of course it is.

M: Good. Everyone in Overwatch believes very strongly in protecting and helping -- it's what drew us together. If you truly want to be one of us, you need to have that desire, too.

N: Her words resonate within you, and you know this is absolutely where you want to be. You don't have to search far to find the desire she speaks of; it's always been there, ever since you first saw the ocean as a young child.

It was such an awesome, inspiring thing. Not a flat, glassy plane like a lake, but something with real power and energy. The waves rose, crested, and crashed upon the shore, foam tickling your feet, and you thought the ocean might be alive.

P: I do.

M: Yes. I think you do.

      

      The aircraft shudders suddenly and violently with turbulence, and you dig your fingertips into the harness as you clutch it tightly. Brushing her fringe out of her face, Mei turns in her seat to gaze out of a window at the view.

T: {i}Sorry, bit of a rough patch there! Should be smooth flying for now.

N: Bright blue fills the windows as the aircraft lifts above the fluffy clouds into the clear, blue sky above. The clouds spread out below the aircraft like marshmallow fluff, appearing so soft you could nap upon them.

Of course, they're nothing but water formed into majestic shapes, but you can dream, right? It's a silly thought, to compare them to marshmallows or pillows -- or marshmallowy pillows -- but you just can't help it.

You angle your head to look over at Mei, who seems enthralled by the view. Her breaths fog the glass of her window as she takes in the bright cloudscape, her face filled with a childlike joy.

As the aircraft smooths out, and the space fills with golden sunlight, you snuggle into your coat and close your eyes, lulled by the soft hum of the aircraft's engine. After an early start and a busy morning, your eyes could use a rest...

...

TITLE: MEI/DEPLOYMENT ONE/THAT SURE IS SNOW

BG: AIRCRAFT INTERIOR


      N: A sharp jolt startles you awake. For a moment, your drowsy mind can't make sense of where you are, until the pilot's voice crackles over the transport's comms.

T: {i}Welcome to Antarctica, everyone! The temperature outside is a frosty really-damn-cold, with a low of turns-your-blood-to-ice. Glad I ain't sticking around long.{/i}

N: You yawn and shake half-forgotten dreams from your head, wondering just how long you've been out for, and what the time actually is in Antarctica. {w=0.1}You forgot to even ask how long the trip would be. Typical.

One day you'll remember to ask for more information. You figure being informed is probably a good thing to master when you're a member of Overwatch. {w=0.25}{i}Especially{/i} a member that's supposed to be a scientist. 

Whoops.

And thinking of being an Overwatch member... {w=0.1}you always assumed there'd be some kind of initiation ceremony, or maybe a hazing ritual for newbies. You even did your hair  this morning just in case of photos, or... or... {w=0.25}something.

But you guess that's not really a thing -- or maybe you were whisked away too quickly for this mission. For all you know, you'll be fully inducted upon your return, when you prove you're truly worthy.

What a dream... to stand beside the heroes like Tracer and Winston and be counted as one of them -- not only by those in Overwatch, but by you yourself. What a day that'll be! Your stomach does backflips just thinking of it.

For now, though, you have other things to deal with: Mei's already out of her seat and opening the rear ramp, and, upon some scientific calculation, you decide there's a hell of a lot of snow outside. Did you really expect anything less?

The bitter chill of what must can only be the worst place on Earth seeps into the transport, seeming to finding every minuscule gap in the material of your clothing. You escape your harness and stand, hoping movement will warm you.

Rubbing your gloved hands together -- friction to cause heat, or so you hope -- you move over to the transport's opening, a door that folds out into a ramp. There's probably some fancy aircraft term for it. To you, it's a door-ramp.

<<bg>> ANTARCTICA EXTERIOR 1
      
Mei: Bit chilly, isn't it?

N: She's awfully bright despite the cold, and that in itself somehow helps make the cold less awful. As if she herself is radiating warmth just by existing. 

You smile, and it feels like your skin is frozen so that you kind of have to force the smile to happen. You hope you don't look as if you're experiencing rigor mortis. That's probably {i}not{/i} a good look.

She grins right back at you, making you think you don't look very corpse-like after all. Though... she could just be one of those nice people who are nice {i}all the time{/i}. A terrifying thought. Those people have too much power.

Standing at the top of the ramp, framed by bright light, Mei takes in the overwhelming whiteness that surrounds us. You can't see her face, but the way she holds her shoulders is relaxed.

You gather up as much as you can carry and approach her silhouetted form. Outside: snow everywhere, but a clear sky and a shining sun that hangs low in the sky. And, your new home.

The structure bursts from the snow, a dark building dusted with white like icing sugar atop a pastry -- and what you wouldn't do for jelly donut. The Watchpoint looks pretty new, as if it hasn't settled into the glimmering landscape yet.

M: A lot of eco-Watchpoints are pretty recent. This one is newly established, maybe the newest. I think it was only set up last month? We're the first people assigned here. 

N: She must have been thinking of the same thing as you, given you're both staring at the Watchpoint.{w=0.1}.{w=0.1}. or she's a mindreader. 

Really, you wouldn't be surprised if someone in Overwatch could read minds. There {i}is{/i} a sentient gorilla who can talk, after all. Nothing is impossible in your mind anymore. {w=0.25}Almost anything.

So... you decide to test this theory, with science. They didn't give you that degree for nothing.

...

{i}Mei! If you can hear this... give me a thumbs up.{/i}

Mei doesn't react at all, her hands tucked into her pockets. You deduce that she's probably not a mindreader... or she's super crafty. Perhaps you'll never know the truth. You resign yourself to the knowledge this will forever be a mystery.

{i}Wait, this is stupid.{/i}

You shake your head. Mei raises her eyebrows at you.

M: Are you okay? 

P: Yeah! Just feeling a little hungry.

M: You and me both! Once we get everything into the Watchpoint, we can have something to eat. Have you ever been to a Watchpoint before? Wait -- of course not! They have full kitchen facilities, though I'm not sure how stocked it will be...

But! We'll make something delicious when we're done, then we can prepare and relax. We'll head out to find the penguins first thing tomorrow. It's too late today to do it, once that sun goes down the temperature drops fast.

N: She shivers dramatically, bouncing a little as she rubs her arms with her gloved hands. Little puffs of breath cloud around her face.

M: It's too cold! Let's get everything done as quickly as we can. I'm keen to warm up, and I'd hate to get you sick on your first day. 

P: I'd hate to {i}get{/i} sick on my first day.

N: A blast of ice-cold air freezes your face even more as you step out onto the ramp. All around you is blinding white below the most vibrant blue you've ever seen. {w=0.25}You wonder if noses can actually fall off when they're cold enough.

You take another step and the moment your foot meets the ramp, you feel it slide against the icy metal.

Your leg flies forward. {w=0.1}You fly backwards.

{i}Not even five minutes in.{/i}

You flail your arms around helplessly, equipment flying off into the snow, and know it's too late to save yourself. You close your eyes and wait to hit the hard metal --

{w=0.25}Strong arms encircle you, catching you mid-fall. You hang suspended, momentarily confused as to why your head hasn't connected painfully with the ground. 

Opening you eyes, you see Mei's warm eyes looking right back at you. {w=0.1}Heat rises in your cheeks, either from embarrassment, or...

Ignoring your thoughts, you focus instead on Mei, who continues to surprise you with her strength. Lugging her climate equipment around must have gained her some mad guns. You wouldn't want to arm wrestle her, you'd definitely lose.

M: Are you okay? Are you hurt? 

N: Her eyes are wide with worry, and why wouldn't they be? She's never met you and your clumsy self before today. 

P: Yeah, I'm fine. That happens sometimes. Thanks for the catch.

M: I can't have my new assistant hurting {$Reflexive} on {$possessive} first day. What would HQ think of me then?

N: Her voice sounds sincere, but there's a cheeky quirk to her mouth as she helps you to your feet. 

Scattered in the snow is everything you were holding only moments ago, like a chaotic testament to your clumsiness. Hopefully you didn't break anything.

P: Sorry

N: Mei waves a hand dismissively.

<meihappy> M: It's okay! It's not your fault the ramp was slipperier than you expected. We'll just have to learn from that lesson so nobody else falls over.

Do you want some help picking everything up?

      ///INCONSEQUENTIAL CHOICE///

      First choice: No, I can do it.
Second choice: Yes, some help would be nice.

      ///FIRST CHOICE///

      P: No, no. It's fine, I can do it myself. I did drop everything, after all.

<meidefault> M: Okay... if you say so. Be careful though, I don't want you hurting yourself more.

P: Ha! I'll be a-okay.
      
      <meihappy> M: Good, you better be! And you better not be denying my help just to impress me.

N: She presses a finger to your chest; a warning, but not a serious one. It's your turn for a dismissive gesture now.  

P: Of course not!

<meidefault> N: She narrows her eyes at you, and she's probably right to. Are you trying to impress her? The odds are pretty high that you are, not that you'll ever admit it.

M: Good. 

P: But is it working?

M: Is what working?

P: Are you impressed?

M: Haha! Hahaha! You haven't done anything impressive yet. Maybe if you carry everything here to the Watchpoint yourself in one trip I will be. 

P: Is that a challenge?

<meiworried> M: Oh, no! I wouldn't want you to hurt yourself attempting that. 

P: I'm kidding. 

<meidefault> M: Oh! Oh. Of course you are. <meihappy>You had me worried for a moment there, haha. 

{w=0.25}<meidefault>I don't want to rush you or anything, but you should probably pick that stuff up before it sinks into the snow and is lost to us forever.

P: Wait, how deep {i}is{/i} the ice? That can happen?

N: You turn quickly on your heels to follow Mei's instructions, but her giggling makes you pause.

M: Sorry, I was kidding about losing everything. But leaving it lying there probably isn't a good idea!

N: You roll your eyes at her, then carefully make your way down the ramp. The snow is much firmer than you expected. Instead of sinking below the surface of the snow, your boots rest atop it as if it were solid ground rather than frozen water.

Mei watches you the entire time, and though she looks chilled out -- {i}ha{/i} -- you feel like she's ready to pounce to your aid once again. 

On one hand, it's sweet that she's worried about you. On the other hand... this might get annoying, if she thinks you're a risk to yourself.

You crouch down to pick up something that looks a bit like a weird, science-fictiony trumpet -- you have no clue what it might do -- and when you stand and check back over your shoulder Mei's disappeared back into the aircraft.

It takes you longer than you expect to pick up everything you flung across the snow, partly because walking on snow isn't a cakewalk. It may be firm, but your boots still sink slightly. You take soft steps, worried you'll be engulfed.

Mei reappears at the top of the ramp, arms once more filled with scientific objects, and she practically skips down onto the snow without seeming to worry about slipping. You suppose she meant {i}you{/i} needed to learn, not her.

She's not wrong.

M: Have you got everything?

P: I think so. What's this trumpet thing?

N: Mei makes a face at the device you indicate.

M: I, um, don't remember. <meihappyblush>That's silly, isn't it? A scientist who can't remember her own inventions.

P: Wait, you made this?

M: Yeah! I invented most of this stuff. Not all of it works, though.

P: That's amazing! That you invented it, I mean. 

M: Oh, um... you really think so?

P: Of course I do. I can barely get my toaster to work some days, let alone build anything with even half a chance of running.

<meihappy> M: Your toaster? Really?

P: Look, it's got a lot of buttons. It's a fancy toaster.

M: A fancy toaster. Mm-hmm. {w=0.1}I can show you how to use the toaster here if it's too complicated for you.

But, I think you'll be fine. You seem smart enough to figure something like that out.

P: Thanks. I think.

N: She laughs and starts heading towards the Watchpoint. You quickly follow behind, squinting against the harsh sun reflected from the ice and snow. Who knew Antarctica would be so bright? Not you, that's for sure.

The Watchpoint doesn't look all that different to the Overwatch headquarters, not really. You suppose there's an overarching Overwatch aesthetic, that a lot of their Watchpoints look similar. 

In the distance are massive ice formations, lit by the lowering sun, and you can't help but hope you'll be heading in that direction later. Sure, frozen water isn't exactly your specialty, but you know it can look damn impressive. 

Water. Is. Amazing.

Variable: $HeatDisc

      P: Not going to lie, some help would be appreciated. Sorry.

M: No worries! We all need help with something sometimes. You don't need to apologize.

P: Yeah, okay. But I'm still sorry.

M: Stop that! Four hands are faster than two, anyway.

P: Four hands? Isn't it two heads?

M: Heads can't pick anything up! Four hands are far more useful than two heads, don't you think?

P: You're... totally right. Yeah.

M: Of course I am.

N: You can't help but feel bad as she follows you into the snow to start digging out the scattered equipment. If not for you, she could already be half-done by now. Instead, she's stuck with you out here in the cold.

Still... you're not sure you mind much. It's not like you don't like being around her, with her sweet smile and even sweeter voice. At least she looks properly bundled up for this temperature, unlike you.

Not that you're overly unprepared -- you're definitely not going to die, or lose any fingers -- but the chill has absolutely seeped into your skin by now and made itself home. You imagine twenty hot showers won't erase its bitter caress.

Your fingers wrap around a rounded disc, and you pull it free from the ice. You inspect it for a moment, completely unsure of what this thing could be. A weird frisbee? A slightly useless bowl? You have no clue.

P: What {i}is{/i} this?

M: What? Oh! That's an exothermal disc.

P: An exo-what?

M: It's a disc that slowly releases heat. The idea is that you can bury it, and it'll warm up the ground for ecosystems that need warmer earth. It might not be very useful here, huh?

P: Sounds good for a cold bed.

M: Haha, that's one use for it! Maybe I will try that if it gets really cold tonight.

P: Will it get really cold?

M: Out here, yes! Inside, probably not unless something goes wrong. Watchpoints, especially ones in volatile environments, tend to have the best climate control. Perfect temperature indoors all day and night.

P: That's reassuring. I hope the food's as good as the temperature.

M: I think that might be up to us and our cooking skills. Now is a good time to tell me if you're a gourmet chef, by the way. 

P: Alas, I am not.

<meiworried> M: I thought as much... <meihappy>But we'll be fine! We'll figure it out.

N: Mei straightens and looks around, but there doesn't seem to be anything else you dropped lying around out here. No evidence of your clumsiness except a confused mess of bootprints surrounding the transport's ramp.

Somewhere in that aircraft is the pilot, who seems to have either completely forgotten about you both, or just doesn't want to help out at all. You can't blame them, really. They're probably holed up in the cockpit napping.

Still, you can't imagine just sitting back and letting someone else do all the work when you could be helping. That's partly why you've wanted to be in Overwatch for so long; if you can help them, why not at least try?

Aid people where you can. Relieve difficulties when possible. That's what you believe. 

The {i}crunch, crunch{/i} of footsteps on the snow draws your attention away from the aircraft and back to Mei, who's started heading to the Watchpoint while you zoned out. She looks over her shoulder at you.

M: You coming?

P: Yeah.

N: She pauses to wait for you to catch up, a soft smile upon her face. The sun bounces off the white landscape just right, illuminating her hair as if she were haloed -- an angel of climatology. Her eyes glow.

{i}Are all Overwatch agents this beautiful?{/i}

She turns away from you again, and the moment passes. You almost think you saw her cheeks coloured with red before she hid her face from you. Probably from you staring at her like that.

Embarrassment fills your stomach like an expanding heat, and you watch your feet the rest of the way to the Watchpoint's entrance.

<<bg>> Eco-Watchpoint Interior
      
It takes you two trips to get everything inside. By the time you're finished, your arms are aching down to the bone and you're sweating beneath all your layers. You throw yourself onto a chair, huffing and puffing with exhaustion.

You're not exactly unfit, not really, but it's been a while since you've done anything so intensive. You decide to get back into a good workout regime when you get home, or back to base. Where doesn't matter, as long as there's a treadmill.

Mei, however, looks fine. As if she hasn't just lugged what feels like a thousand kilograms from the transport to the Watchpoint. You're not sure whether to admire or fear her power.

You decide to do both. Adfear. Feadmire.

{i}Hmm. I need to work on my portmanteaus.{/i}

Mei puts her hands on her hips and grins.

<meihappy> M: Good work, team!

P: You're half of the team. Are you congratulating yourself?

M: Half of the congratulations go to me. The other half, to you. 

N: You give her a weak thumbs up, your arm trembling with the effort it takes just to raise it. You can only hope a good sleep and some food will make you feel better, or else tomorrow will be hell. And thinking of food...

Your stomach growls, loud enough that it's impossible Mei doesn't notice.

M: Guess you're hungry! How about I check out the kitchen and make us some dinner? <meidefault> You stay here, I don't want you passing out on the kitchen floor.

P: I wouldn't pass out, I'm fiiiine.

N: Mei watches as you try to lift yourself from your seat, muscles shaking with effort and fatigue. You're not going anywhere.

You collapse back against the chair, glaring at Mei's smug expression. She doffs her gloves, and pulls the little drone strapped to her back free. It hovers beside her, little boosters keeping it afloat. She pats its head.

M: This is Snowball. Snowball, meet {$Playername}.

S: (=^?^=)

      /// INCONSEQUENTIAL CHOICE///

      FIRST CHOICE: Hey there.
SECOND CHOICE: What the hell is that?
      
///FIRST CHOICE///

      P: Hey there, Snowball. Nice to meet you.

S: ?(???)?

N: Panels at the side of the drone's round head flap out like the ears of a happy dog, and you get the feeling that the droid is feeling pretty great as it bobs in the air before you.

M: Perfect, you two can keep an eye on each other while I make something to eat. Be nice, Snowball!

S: ??(? ? ?)?? 

N: Mei pats the little drone on the head, then heads off to the kitchen, which isn't all that far from where you're sitting. She's certainly not out of earshot, which gives you a strange sense of relief...

<no Mei> You're not sure you trust this drone. It's cute. {w=0.1}Too cute. {w=0.1}Nothing {i}that{/i} cute is entirely innocent. For all you know, it could be planning to off you the second it thinks you might hurt its owner.

Not that you would ever think of hurting Mei, but how's Snowball supposed to know that? Short answer: it can't.

You watch the drone as the clatter of Mei working away in the kitchen fills the room. Snowball floats around, inspecting the Watchpoint and everything you've brought inside. 

After a while, when its curiosity is sated, the drone flies back over to you and settles down in the air nearby, waiting patiently for Mei to return. It's not unlike a cat, you think.

S: (????)

N: Yeah. It's definitely planning something. 

P: So... what's it like being, y'know, a robot?

S: ?(?)?

P: Yeah. About the same being a human, too.

S: ?????

N: Its ears flap and it bleeps, and you think this is the drone's way of showing laughter. Or it could be Snowball threatening your life. Both options are equally possible, you decide.

Mei returns quicker than you expect, both hands holding huge, steaming bowls that smell... meaty. She places on in your lap, and sits beside you with the other.

Filling the bowl is a thick, chunky stew swimming with carrots, potatoes, lentils, and an unidentified meat of some kind. Your best scientific guess is beef. Maybe. The scent is certainly mouthwatering, at least.

P: Smells good.

M: Thanks! But it's not all me. This is just a packaged protein-rich stew I warmed up. Who knows what's actually in this.

P: Curiosity killed the cat. I'm just hungry.

N: The two of you dig into the stew, and it's possibly the most delicious thing you've had in years -- it's at least the first warm thing you've eaten all day, and {i}damn{/i} does it feel good. Already you can feel your exhaustion fading.

You would marry this stew, if you could. Marry it and its ambiguous meat.

{i}Okay, this is getting weird.{/i}

P: If I ever meet whoever makes this stuff, I'm giving them the biggest high-five.

M: I think you might just be biased because all you've eaten all day has been my protein bars. Which aren't terrible, but they're no hot stew.

P: Maybe I'm just biased because you made it.

M: What?

P: What?

<meihappyblush> N: You shove another spoonful of stew into your mouth, hoping that you can't say anything else stupid through the food. Mei watches you for a moment, then pulls out her datapad and focuses on that instead.

{i}Ugh. Stupid! What was that?{/i}

M: {i}Ahem{/i}. So. First thing tomorrow we're off to find the penguins. 

P: Any idea where they are?

<meidefault> M: We have some satellite images that theoretically tell us which direction to go. We have a small craft to travel in, so at least the journey shouldn't take {i}too{/i} long.

P: That's crafty.

N: Mei chokes on her mouthful of stew as she tries to refrain from laughing, smacking a hand across her mouth as she coughs.

<meisurprise> M: {i}Hk!{/i} Ah! Guh!

P: I'm sorry!

M: No, it's -- aha -- it's fine. Do not let my death hinder your humour.

<meidefault> N: She waves away your worries, returning to her stew as soon as her coughing subsides. You watch her stealthily as you finish your own food, making sure that you haven't accidentally caused her serious damage.

You guess you're going to have to be more careful when it comes to jokes. You could kill someone, and there are only two someones here: you, and Mei.

You don't particularly want to kill either of those people.
      
///SECOND CHOICE///

      P: What the hell {i}is{/i} that thing?

M: My assistant drone, Snowball. It helps me out, and makes a good companion on solo deployments.

S: (;???)

N: Mei pats the drone's round head, and it bobs in the air, nuzzling up against her hand.

S: ?(???)? 

P: Right...

<meiworried> M: What, you don't like it?

S: (???)

P: No, no! I think Snowball's cute. Hey... pal.

S: ?(???)?

M: I think Snowball likes you. Be nice to it, will you? I don't want you two fighting!

P: Of course! What kind of person do you take me for? A bot-bully?

<meihappyblush> M: You really can't tell these days. <meihappy>But! I'm sure you two will be the best of friends. Play nice while I go make dinner.

P: Yeah, yeah.

S: ?(?)?

<meiworried> M: {i}Snowball{/i}...

S: ?`???)

M: That's the best I'm getting out of you, isn't it?

S: ??(? ? ?)?? 

<meidefault> N: Mei gives you an apologetic smile, then disappears off to prepare dinner. You're just glad that the kitchen isn't out of earshot, because you're not entirely sure you trust this drone.

P: Hey Snowball, you wouldn't hurt a human, right?

S: ?(?)?

P: Uh... That's a yes, right?

S: ?(???)?

N: Little flaps at the side of Snowball's head flutter along with little beeps in a way that you think is meant to approximate laughter, and you realise suddenly that the drone is probably messing with you.

P: Right. I get it, you're a joker.

N: What could it do to you anyway? Lightly headbutt you? Make faces? You shake your head and laugh. The drone laughs -- kind of -- along with you. It seems pleased that you're amused by its joke.

{i}I'm losing it.{/i}

Now that you've figured out Snowball's just kidding around, you feel as if you've bonded with the little drone. It settles down on the chair beside you, its little jets turned off as it sits and waits for Mei like a patient pet.

S: (???)

P: Yeah, me too. 

N: You close your eyes, just resting them for a second. You're snuggled up all nice and warm in your layers of clothes, inside a nicely temperature building with food on the way. There's not much better than this...

...

...

<meidefault> M: Hey! 

P: Wh --

N: You jolt awake, your eyes flying open. Mei stands before you with a bowl filled with what looks and smells like a steaming-hot stew.

M: Not going to pass out, huh?

P: I didn't pass out! I was... resting my eyes.

M: Ah, napping.

P: ... yeah.

M: Well, here's some food for you, sleepyhead.

N: Chuckling, Mei holds the bowl out for you to take, which you do gratefully. The warmth of the dish is comforting as you hold it in your lap, and the smell of the meat -- maybe beef, you're not sure -- makes your mouth water.

Mei reaches out to Snowball, who has another bowl balanced upon its head, and takes the bowl into her hands. Dishing a mouthful into her mouth, she takes a seat beside you and digs into her food.

You follow her lead, feeling instant, wonderful relief as the flavours of the stew explode in your mouth. What could be better than nice, hot food? Nothing. {w=0.1}Literally. {w=0.1}Nothing.

P: It's good! Thank you!

<meihappyblush> M: You're welcome, though I just followed the instructions on a packet. It's not rocket science, or climate science.

P: It's still good. If this is the kind of packaged food Overwatch has, I think I'm gonna stick around.

M: Good! I like having you around. Though...

P: Though?

<meihappy> M: We'll see how useful you are tomorrow. Could totally change my mind!

P: Yikes.

M: I'm sure you'll do great.

P: I'll certainly try my best.

M: Good! I wouldn't want it any other way.
      
/////
      
Mei places her bowl at her feet and stretches, yawning widely. 

M: Ooh, I'm exhausted! I think it's time for bed. 

P: I think I agree.

N: You can't help yawning yourself -- it's contagious! The food certainly helped you feel less like a limp noodle, but you can't deny just how tired you feel. Despite your nap of an indeterminable number of hours, it's been one hell of a day.

Plus, having something warm in your stomach is making you feel more than a little drowsy... 

You suppose it's time to head to your room and snooze for as long as you possibly can before Mei drags you out into the frozen wasteland that is Antarctica again.

Mei helps you up and the two of you grab your personal bags and heave the straps over your shoulders -- rather, that's what Mei does. You drag your luggage behind you like the weakling you are. Together, you head to the crew's quarters.

Mei pauses before two doors that look identical, and seems to consider them both for a short while before turning to you.

M: Since this is your first deployment, and since I'm super nice, I'm going to let you pick which room you want. It doesn't matter that much, but at least you get to control a little bit of your what is, for now, your home.

P: Oh, okay. Thank you.

Hmmm...

M: You'll see. We'll be spending enough time together for you to learn. Have I been wrong yet today?

P: No, but...

M: Never wrong!

P: {i}Pffft{/i}. Fine.

N: She pauses for a moment, as if unsure of what to say next. You consider trying to fill the silence, but instead find yourself watching the way her eyelashes flutter when she blinks. They look so soft and delicate. Amazing.

She shakes her head slightly -- almost imperceptibly -- and moves towards her room, with a little wave in your direction.

M: Well! Good night. I'll see you bright and early.

P: Good night, don't let the penguins bite.

N: You head into your own room, taking in the bed, the desk, and the complete lack of anything bright to make it feel like a home. At least there's a window, made from what you can only assume is super-strong glass to survive the weather.

The door doesn't quite click closed properly behind you, but you're too tired to do much about that right now. On a list of Most Important Things In Antarctica, a door that doesn't quite close properly is pretty damn low.

You have some photos with you, packed away in your bags -- and, yes, they're photos of food, you're not ashamed of it, though maybe you should be. You'll put them up tomorrow. For now, however, you collapse face first onto your bed.

P: Do you have any preference?

M: None at all! It is completely up to you.

P: Okay. Then, right it is.

M: Perfect! I'll take the left.

N: You move towards the right room, dragging your bag behind you, but hesitate before you open the door. You feel like you should say something more to Mei. She has, after all, put up with your useless self all day.

Correction: she has to put up with your useless self for as long as this deployment lasts. Poor lady.

M: Are you okay?

P: Yeah...

N: No words spring to mind, and you find yourself distracted by how silky her hair looks. 

{i}Definitely bed time!{/i}

P: Good night. See you in the morning, I guess.

M: Oh, you will.

N: She disappears into her room, and you into yours, and you collapse into your bed without even taking the time to look around. You can always do that tomorrow. For now, your mind is filled with thoughts of Mei.

TITLE: MEI/DEPLOYMENT ONE/WAIT, HOW MANY PENGUINS?

BG: ANTARCTICA EXTERIOR 1

      N: You raise your hand to block out the blinding light of the sun, squinting against the brightness. Your action is in vain, the sun bounces off of the {i}light-reflective{/i}, white snow that literally surrounds you.

{i}It's too early for this.{/i}

You tromp through the snow towards the snowcraft hovering slightly above the ground, its engines purring softly. Mei sits at the front, behind a windscreen that stretches around her like a weird bubble.

With a certain amount of dismay, you realise that while the snowcraft is made for transporting objects for scientific research and analysis, the car-sized compartment for storing said objects is not made for humans.

Also, as Mei explained you earlier, the compartment is usually kept cold on purpose, because many of the objects are just ice with stuff frozen inside that nobody wants to melt unexpectedly.

Instead of a nice, comfortable ride, you and Mei will both have to squish into the small cockpit. At least the view will be nice.

Mei looks up and gives you a wave through the windscreen, bright-eyed and grinning. You feel like death, she looks like a damn angel. How can anyone look that good this early in the morning? Must be magic.

You clamber into the cockpit beside Mei, and instantly realise that she was not lying when she said it'd be a tight fit. The two of you have your sides pressed right together, with no space to spare.

At least you'll be able to keep each other warm if the heaters somehow fail. 

M: You know how to drive this, right?

P: What -- no! I thought you did?

N: You have no clue what she's talking about. You've never once in your life driven something like this, all you know is ordinary everyday cars and boats. Did Overwatch send the wrong person?

<meihappy> She bursts into peals of laughter, taking the control yoke in her hands. 

M: Of course I do! Haha!

N: You heave a sigh of relief, chuckling along with Mei at your own expense. Really, you shouldn't have been so gullible to begin with, and the worst part is, now Mei {i}knows{/i} you're gullible.

They always trick you again when they know. They can't help it. {w=0.25}In all fairness, you'd do the same.

P: That's just cruel.

M: It's funny.

P: That too.

N: You strap into your harness, which is more a seatbelt, and Mei pushes the craft forward with an excited gleam in her eyes. You can't tell if she's more gleeful about the prospect of penguins, or driving this weird craft.

<meidefault> The craft accelerates quickly to what you guess is a decent speed -- it's hard to tell when the landscape whipping by all looks the same -- and the two of you are off, away on an adventure.

Something occurs to you suddenly, something you hadn't considered before. What if you're heading into danger?

P: Um...

M: Yes?

P: Are penguins... dangerous? Will they try to eat us.

M: Oh! No, unless you're a fish they aren't dangerous to you. In fact, they're so unused to humans, there is a very good chance they won't even be scared of us.

P: I guess that's something I should have known.

M: You {i}are{/i} the oceanographer here. Hehe. It's fine. I can't expect you to know everything about every single creature related to the ocean, now can I? You didn't even get time to study Antarctica wildlife before we left.

P: Do you know everything about the climate?

M: Nobody knows everything about anything! But I do know a lot about my field of study, yes.

P: I know a lot about desserts.

<meiworried> M: There's no ocean in a desert!

P: {i}Desserts{/i}. 

M: Oh! {w=0.25} <meihappy> That makes much more sense. Are there any desserts that involve fish?

P: I have heard of people using sturgeon in some things... Though that may have been for one of those cooking competition rather than served food at a restaurant. More often people make desserts shaped like fish.

M: Food nerd.

P: I'll own it.

P: You really seem to love the cold. Ice cream, Snowball... Antarctica.

M: I didn't choose to come to Antarctica, though this deployment was my idea.

P: Fine, penguins!

<meihappy> M: You got me there. I have always liked the cold, ever since I first saw snow as a child. It's a beautiful thing, is it not? 

P: Yeah.

<meidefault> M: Besides, the cold just feels nice. I would rather be cold than hot. I am definitely a winter person. Commander Morrison, however, is a spring person.

N: You think of the Commander in springtime, trying to imagine his gruff form amidst a field of blooming flowers. It's impossible. You can't see it.

P: What about me?

M: Hmm...

N: Mei glances at you quickly, then looks back outside to watch where the craft is going -- not that it matters, there's not much where you are. 

She chews her lip, lost in thought.

M: Hmmmm{w=0.1}.{w=0.1}.{w=0.1}.

I am not actually sure. I think I need to spend a little more time with you before I decide, something that I am not complaining about, yet.

P: Yet.

///SECOND CHOICE///

VARIABLE: $Tacos

      P: I think I could eat tacos forever and never get sick of them, you know? They're just so good. Literally humanity's greatest creation.

M: I am fond of fish tacos.

N: You watch her face for any sly smirks, and find her to be sincere. At least, as sincere as Mei {i}can{/i} be. You never expected her to be such a prankster. Must be where Snowball gets it from, you decide.

P: I can make a pretty good fish taco.

M: Oh! If only we had the ingredients back at the Watchpoint. Maybe we can request them for our next batch of supplies, if we're here long enough for that. 

If we do that, will you make some?

P: Yeah, of course.

<meihappy> M: Cool! Now I am kind of hoping we stay here long enough for a resupply, if only for tacos.

P: There are tacos back in civilization.

<meidefault> M: Yeah... {i}Sigh{/i}. I am so often away on deployments, I don't get a chance to go out and eat anything exciting. Sometimes Tracer brings me a burger or two. She is lovely.

P: I promise you, we will eat tacos at some point.

M: I'm going to hold you to that, you know.

P: Fine by me. 

N: Your stomach grumbles at the thought of tacos. This conversation was a bad idea, you realise. Breakfast wasn't even that long ago, and already you're getting hungry again. Who knows when you'll be able to have lunch?
      
///THIRD CHOICE///

VARIABLE: $FirstDate

      P: Haggis.

M: Haggis?

P: Haggis.

<meigrumpy> M: Eugh! That's disgusting.

P: Don't knock it till you try it. When we get back to Earth, I'm taking you out to get haggis.

M: Earth?

P: Uh, back to civilization, rather.

M: Hmm. {w=0.1}Sounds like a date, then. A disgusting date.

N: {i}A... date?!{/i}

Your mouth dries out, and you find yourself unable say anything more to Mei as she guides the craft across the ice. You know she's joking, but still... a date? With Mei? 

And you suggested haggis, of all things. Absolutely not a good first-date meal. Not that you two will actually be going on a date. Your stomach clenches slightly at that thought.

{i}Ugh!{/i}

P: So how much longer until we see the penguins?

M: Not long now, I hope. 

      

      N: You think of the chocolate tucked away in your pockets, a food you did not expect to be so useful for ventures outside in Antarctica. Not that you're complaining at all -- you never refuse an excuse to eat chocolate.

<meidefault> M: I'm glad it's such nice weather. Better than trying to find a colony of penguins in a blizzard. Did you know a group of penguins on land can also be called a waddle? How cute is that?

P: Waddle you do if I say I didn't know that?

<meihappy> M: Ha! Don't make me laugh, I have to drive. Keep your word play to a minimum while we're travelling at speed.

P: Yes, ma'am.

<meidefault> M: It can also be called a rookery. A group of penguins, I mean. Colony, rookery, waddle. Waddle is the best term, in my opinion.

N: It seems to you as if you'll never reach the penguins, that you'll be travelling across the snow and ice until the end of time, forever trying to complete your mission.

But then, in the distance... {w=0.1}a black-and-off-white mass begins to appear, growing larger and larger as you approach. At first, you're stunned by the sight, so much black amongst the white you've become so used to.

You seriously question for the first time just how many penguins you're going to be dealing with here.

M: There they are! Wow, there sure are a lot.

P: Is that every penguin in Antarctica? Sure looks like it.

M: No, definitely not. It is likely only one colony, and I think we should be very thankful of that. Much less work!

<meiworried> {w=0.25}They're definitely a long way from the ocean, or any openings to the ocean. What are they doing out here?

P: Penguin party? 

<meidefault> M: Where did the penguins go to dance?

P: Uh, where?

<meihappy> M: At the snow ball!

P: ...

...

M: Heh. Guess I need to... {i}warm{/i} up the audience first.

N: You can't help but laugh at her terrible jokes. You have to admit, they're better than yours usually are.

P: Haha! Hahaha.

<meidefault> M: But in all seriousness, I doubt the penguins are here to dance.

Something is either compelling them to travel inland -- perhaps they can sense something coming? -- or there is something driving them all away from the ocean.

Hmm... {w=0.25}I hope they're all okay.

P: We'll do our best to help them.

M: Yes! We will fix their problem, whatever it is. {w=0.1}<meihappy>And, we get to see penguins up close!

N: She slows the craft to a stop near the penguins -- not too close as to startle them, but not so far that you have to walk more than necessary. Exercise out here expends a lot of energy that's hard to reclaim with just the food you brought.

For a brief moment, you wonder what penguin might taste like...

But then you completely shut that thought down. What would Mei think of a suggestion like that? She may just freeze you in a block of ice and leave you here.

In your cramped cockpit, you and Mei pull on all your extreme-weather clothes, bundling up as much as possible before braving the below-freezing temperatures outside.

Evolution sure is an impressive thing, that penguins can just chill out in this kind of temperature without batting a birdy eyelash thanks to nature's insulator: fat. You, on the other hand, would die pretty quickly without your clothes.

Nature decidedly did not insulate you very well. To be fair, evolution didn't exactly predict you'd be travelling all the way to the bottom of the Earth. It's not like it's a future-seer, it's just a very long, very slow process.

Still... what you wouldn't give for a bit of that ice-dwelling-creature blubber right now. You brace yourself for the freezing cold, and open the cockpit's door.

Ice-cold air rushes in, your nose freezing in seconds. You clamber out of the craft and down onto the snow, thankful that it holds your weight, and take a proper look around.

Sure, there's snow everywhere -- duh, it's Antarctica -- but there are ice formations not too far away. They rise and curve like waves frozen as they crested, layers of blue-green ice lit as if from within by the sun.

{i}Dang. Not a bad view.{/i}

If you're totally honest with yourself, Antarctica always seemed very bland in your mind. How could so much white be interesting? Well, you're definitely getting shown just how wrong you've been this whole time.

White isn't the only colour here. There's the black and yellow of the penguins, the bright blue sky, the layers of turquoise within the ice, and the pink-red of Mei's cold -- and admittedly cute -- nose. 

And the white itself is far from bland. Snowflakes glitter in the sunlight, filling the world with what could be sparkles. Like stars scattered across the landscape. Sure, it's blinding, but it's pretty.

{i}Note to self: remember your sunglasses.{/i}

Mei clambers out of the craft after you, closing the door behind her and then pausing to admire the view just like you are. She inhales deeply, then exhales, letting out a cloud of frosty air.

<meihappy> M: That's brisk!

P: Tell me about it.

M: If we have free time later in the deployment, would you want to go see those formations? I think I packed a camera somewhere...

      /// INCONSEQUENTIAL CHOICE///

      FIRST CHOICE: Yeah!
SECOND CHOICE: Nah.
THIRD CHOICE: If you want.
      
///FIRST CHOICE///

VARIABLE: $Iceformation

      P: Yeah! Definitely. I'd love to.

M: Yes! Cool! I was hoping you would want to. They look quite beautiful from afar, don't they?

P: Quite... a-{i}Mei{/i}-zing, you could say.

<meisurprise> N: Mei's eyes widen with delight, and then she doubles over laughing. <meihappy>You gather she's a fan of your joke. You are so glad you were paired with someone who appreciates you.

M: Haha, that is amazing. A-Mei-zing! I am absolutely going to use that. Hahaha!

P: It's all yours.

N: She claps her hands together, face so filled with joy she seems almost brighter than the sunlit snow. You're not sure you've ever met someone as wonderful as Mei.

M: Enough jokes! <meidefault>We must get to business. These penguins are not going to sort themselves out. Or at least, I am sure they would appreciate some help.

P: What kind of penguins are these, by the way?

M: Oh! Emperor penguins. Aptenodytes forsteri, if you want their scientific name. They are the tallest and heaviest of all penguin species, growing over a meter tall! They can also live up to twenty years.

P: A meter? I always thought penguins were small.

M: Oh no, definitely not. I wouldn't want to be tiny if I lived here. I think the smallest penguins to be found in Antarctica are the rockhoppers. They look like they have little punk hairstyles.

P: Oh, yeah, I know the ones you mean.

N: You're not going to lie, her saying they look like they have hairstyles did help you remember which penguins she meant. Yeah, maybe you didn't pay much attention when learning about Antarctica and seabirds. You still got your degree.

Mei starts towards the penguins, trying to move as smoothly as she can when bundled up and walking through snow.
      
///SECOND CHOICE///

      P: Nah. I think I'm okay just seeing them from here.

<meiworried> M: Oh, okay... That's fair.

N: It's pretty clear you upset her a little, she must have been excited by the idea of going to see the ice.

P: You can always go, though! You don't have to drag me along.

M: Yeah... I guess so. 

N: She looks downcast as she pouts her lips subconsciously, clasping her hands before her. She gazes out at the formations, and you feel a pang in your heart. She might like the ice, but you feel like the cold-hearted one here.

<meidefault> M: No point worrying about that now though! We have penguins to deal with.

N: At her own mention of penguins, her eyes light up again. {i}Whew{/i}. You're past that for now. If she asks again you might just change your mind, becuase you'd hate to make her think you don't want to spend time with her.

M: Did you know Emperor penguins bow repeatedly to each other when courting? The male will bow to a female he likes, and she'll bow back if she likes him too. It's so cute!

N: She mimics a little bow, her hands straight by her side like penguin wings.

You bow back, feeling a little like a dork as you pretend to be a penguin. It works, though, because she looks much happier than she did only a few moments ago.

<meihappy> M: Just like that! Except with more weird penguin burbling, which is probably super romantic if you're a lady penguin.

P: You sure know a lot about penguins.

M: It's because I love them! Just like you know a lot about food.

<meidefault>Besides, I've known for a while where this deployment would take me once we got an oceanographer working with us, so I've had time to study a bit.

Anyway! Penguins!

P: Right!

N: As Mei starts towards the penguins, you think of their little courting ritual. Mei bowed to you -- was that just a silly demonstration, or hints of something else?

{i}Don't be ridiculous!{/i}

You decide that of course she was just demonstrating. Still, as you follow behind her, you can't entirely decide why you bowed back.
      
///THIRD CHOICE///

      P: If you want to. It's up to you.

M: Hmm. I think it would be nice, don't you? But only if we end up having time for it! 

P: Okay, that sounds good.

M: Perfect! I wish I had more time to explore this continent, I wonder if I'll be allowed to stay here when this deployment is done, or if I'll have to move on. Antarctica does need observation, it's a critical danger zone.

P: Critical danger zone?

M: Places that, if a massive ecological disaster happens, could seriously affect the world in a very negative way. If Antarctica melts, low-lying places on Earth will flood, and we'll lose Earth's natural aircon, raising temperatures more.

P: Oh, right. That's not good.

<meiworried> M: No, it's really not. That's why I took stepped up to this job. If nobody does anything, we'll lose our planet. There are more important things in this world than just humans, we have to protect all life here.

Really, it is very selfish that the climate and natural environments have been so low on governments' agendas for so long. Don't they know how important it is? They must! If humanity dies out, what does everything else matter?

<meidefault> {i}Sigh{/i}. I am sorry. I didn't mean to rant. I just get so worked up about this!

N: Her cheeks are rosy, and her eyes are shining with her passion for what she does. She is certainly worked up, but it gives her a certain fire that shows just how much she cares. You feel inspired to save the world.

P: You don't have to be sorry. I agree.

M: You do? Good! Then they didn't send you here with me for nothing. I would hate to think an oceanographer didn't care about the environment anyway. I just wish more people listened to us.

P: I'm sure they'd listen to you. It's obvious how much passion you have for the environment.

M: Maybe... They might just think I am a massive dork, though.

P: Aren't you?

<meihappyblush> M: No worse than you.

N: She rubs a gloved hand across her nose, looking over at the gathered penguins. You think they're a good two hundred meters from where the two of you stand, but you're not really sure.

<meidefault> M: Penguin time?

P: Penguin time.

N: You both head in the direction of the penguins, taking care to not make any sudden movements that might startle the birds which means that really, you kind of waddle over.

You can't say the penguins don't know what they're about with that waddling.
      


<<bg>> ANTARCTICA EXTERIOR 2
      
N: As you approach the penguins, you scientifically conclude that there are a {i}lot{/i} of them. A swaying abundance of birds. A jiggling avian swarm. A veritable plethora of penguins.

Too many to count, that's for sure, and they're far from quiet quiet.

There's a mass of sound emanating from the penguins, a warbling mish-mash of trumpeting and braying unlike anything you've ever heard before. There's an edge to the noise, like distress or fear. Beaked faces turn to watch you both.

You stand at the edge of the colony while the penguins honk at you, but Mei carefully makes her way deeper into the congregation of chubby birds. She stands out, so you don't worry about losing her amongst the penguins.

P: You have any plans?

M: I'm going to run a few non-invasive tests on some of them. Do you think they look a little freaked out?

N: You're not really a penguin expert, but the way they shuffle definitely looks a little anxious. They dart their heads around, as if watching for something. And yet, they don't seem particularly scared of you.

P: Yeah, I'd say so.

<meiworried> M: Hmmm...

One of the birds bumps against you and wanders off, and you're surprised by the weight of the thing. No wonder they can't fly, there's no way they'd get that mass off of the ground. 

As Mei works, you watch the penguins mill about. The little orange-yellow patches at their throats remind you of the gradients of a golden sunsent. Now that you're closer, you also notice their backs aren't a uniform black.

Their feathers look soft, though there's no way you're taking off a glove to check. No amount of cuteness would make you that suicidal. Though there are younger penguins with fluffy, grey coats that might test that resolve.

From memory, you recall that the younger penguins' feathers aren't waterproof yet, and that they still need to moult. It's a crime against nature that evolution decided such utter cuteness wasn't viable for adulthood. 

Mei moves back to you, the penguins wobbling very ungracefully out of her path. She holds her infopad tightly in her gloves, far out of the penguins' reach. 

<meidefault> M: They're healthy, as far as I can tell. However, they aren't travelling to the ocean to eat, and... that's not good.

P: But they aren't starving?

M: They store up a lot of body fat to survive them through months of fasting, especially when breeding, so they won't starve yet. However... <meiworried>

P: However?

M: It's moulting season soon, and they need to store up more food or else they're going to compromise their moults. That could very well be what starves them, if they continue to refuse to feed.

P: Do you know why they won't?

M: I have no clue! <meigrumpy> I thought something obvious would present itself once we were here. For all intents and purposes, they are perfectly fine.

P: But something is wrong.

M: Yes. This isn't normal. <meiworried> I'm not sure what to do.

N: You turn away from Mei and take in the penguins again. They bumble about, the weirdest birds you've ever seen, and you feel your stomach tie itself in knots. How on Earth are you supposed to help them?

      ///CONSEQUENTIAL CHOICE///

      FIRST CHOICE <approval - 1>: Maybe there's nothing we can do.
SECOND CHOICE <approval + 1>: We could take them home with us.
      
///FIRST CHOICE///

      P: Maybe there's nothing we can do, nothing we can fix. Nature does weird things sometimes.

M: What?

N: A shadow passes over her eyes as she stares at you intensely through the lenses of her glasses. She puts the pad back into a pocket and crosses her arms, looking very much like a disappointed teacher.

P: I mean, we don't have to do anything right now. They've got time for us to figure out if there is a problem.

<meigrumpy> M: {i}If?{/i} There's no doubt that something is wrong here. And we don't have as much time as you might think! We can't waste time shrugging our shoulders and hoping for the best.

...

<meiworried> I can't just leave them. They're in trouble.

P: You can't stay out here all night. That's going to get you killed. 

N: She sighs, her breath clouding before her. The glare reflecting off her glasses hides her eyes from you, but you can tell by the slump of her shoulders that she's not exactly happy with your suggestion.  

P: We can observe them for a while, see if anything changes? I'm not saying we up and leave the Watchpoint and go home, obviously. I still think we need to do what we can. 

But there's nothing we can do right now.

N: Mei raises her head, her eyes wide wide. She covers a gasp with her hand, then grabs your arm excitedly.

<meihappy> M: But there is something we can do right now! It's genius!

P: What?

M: It won't be easy, and it'll take a couple trips... Hmmm... Can we even fit them...?

P: Fit what?

N: But it's clear she's disappeared into her plan, whatever it is. She pulls out her infopad again and starts tapping away, mumbling to herself as she works. A grin works its way across her face.

You stand silently for a few minutes, waiting for her to resurface and explain everything. It seems that you have totally become non-existent to her in her excitement.

P: What are you planning?

N: She looks up quickly, apparently surprised at your interruption.

M: The Watchpoint!

P: Not to sound repetitive but, what?

M: We can take them to the Watchpoint!

P: Take them...?

N: Her meaning dawns upon you all at once, like a tidal wave of wiggling penguins: she wants to bring the colony -- the waddle -- back to the Watchpoint. The entire lot of them, most likely. No penguin left behind.

Her idea is ridiculous, of course. How on Earth will you fit this many birds into the complex? What does she intend to do with them? Does she expect to feed them? They'll be smelly and loud and... they'll definitely be pooping.

You are {i}not{/i} cleaning that up.

P: Are you sure that's a good plan?

M: Of course it is! We can keep them under direct observation and run better tests on them. <meidefault>I wonder if Jack will be willing to send enough supplies to feed them all...

P: How are we going to get them back to the Watchpoint?

M: In our snowcraft! There's the whole compartment in the back for transport.

P: There are way more penguins here than can fit in there.

M: It'll be a few trips.

P: You're not going to back down from this, are you?

<meihappy> M: Nope! So you can either help me, or stand there like a big jerk. What'll it be?

N: You know that turning down her request will put you even further in her bad books than your last suggestion did, and you're not really willing to risk your mentor-slash-commanding-officer hating you.

So, there's only one thing for it.

P: Yeah. I'll help.

M: Perfect! I knew you would, it's the right choice to make.

N: You're not so sure it's the {i}right{/i} choice, per se, but it's definitely the one that's been made. Whether you like it or not, you've suddenly gained a hundred more roommates.

And you were only just getting used to Snowball.

Oh well, nothing that can be done about it now. At least penguins won't be as sassy as the little drone. {w=0.1}Or so you hope.

      ///SECOND CHOICE///

      P: We could take them back to the base with us.

<meisurprise> M: We could... what?

P: Back to the Watchpoint. We can take care of them there, maybe run more tests. And we'd have constant observation of them.

It's probably not a good idea. Sorry.

M: You don't have to be sorry! I actually like it.

P: You do?

M: Yes! We'll have to lower the temperature of the Watchpoint a little for their comfort, but it is a good way to make sure they're safe while we figure out what's going on.

Plus...

P: Plus?

<meihappy> M: We'll get to live with penguins! How amazing is that?

P: Pretty amazing?

<meidefault> M: Oh! But how will we get them back to the Watchpoint? I'm not sure it's easy to herd penguins.

P: Hmmm...

N: You cast about, looking for anything that could help. You're not sure what you expect to find, the only things here are ice, snow, and an entire community of penguins. Then, something catches your eyes.

There is one more thing nearby, something that could solve your problems.

P: What about the snowcraft?

M: That could work.

P: It'll definitely take more than one trip.

M: Good thing we headed out early, then.

P: Are we really going to do this?

M: Why not? I can't think of anything else we can do for them right now. Once they're secure, we can investigate more.

P: How will we feed them?

M: Poor old Jack's about to get a really big food request, I think.

P: The base is going to smell like fish for a long time, isn't it?

<meihappy> M: Sure is. But it'll be worth it.

N: You can tell by the grin plastered across Mei's face that she's very happy with your idea. You feel a little burst of pride in your chest at that -- maybe you're not so useless on this mission after all!

Still, this is going to a hell of a lot of effort to pull off. You're not sure if penguins particularly like being forcibly moved from their homes.

Then again, it's not like this is their home anyway. At least you and Mei might be able to make them feel a little safer than they seem to feel now. After they get used to being inside a human building.

Poor things, they're about to go on one crazy adventure.

      

      <meidefault> M: I'm going to go bring the craft closer, you wait here.

P: I can do that.

N: Mei nods, then tromps off back towards the craft you two arrived in. As you wait, the penguins seem to slowly surround you, as if absorbing you into their ranks. You guess they like you.

Good thing, that, since you'll all be living together soon.

Mei pulls the craft in slowly and carefully, and while the penguins definitely edge away from the oncoming craft, they don't straight-up turn and run.

Though you're not sure if penguins can run. At least they're not all sliding away on their bellies.

Disembarking the craft, Mei gives you a quick grin, then heads to the back and opens up the storage compartment. She walks back over to you and places a hand on your shoulder.

M: You ready for this?

P: As ready as I'll ever be.

N: The two of you get to work, not entirely sure exactly what you're doing. You reach for the closest penguin and wrap your arm around the creature, but when you try to lift it, the thing slides right out of your grip.

{i}Damn slippery birds.{/i}

The penguin waddles away from you, tooting rudely.

P: Whatever, buddy! I was trying to help you.

Mei manages to heave one of the penguins up and places it into the craft. The penguin looks at her for a moment, then jumps out back into the snow and slides away.

M: Hmph. This isn't going to work. 

P: What else can we do?

N: Mei scratches her head, looking from the snowcraft to the penguin colony. Her furrowed brow betrays her intense thoughts, and you remain silent so as not to disturb her. 

After a few minutes, she perks up. You can almost see the lightbulb flash above her head.

M: Okay, I have an idea.

P: And...?

M: You might not like it.

P: What is it?

M: I have an endothermic ray.

P: An endo-what?

M: {i}Sigh{/i}. An ice-gun. It can freeze things. Not fatally! But enough that we could freeze the penguins to move them easier. Then, when we get to the Watchpoint, we bring the craft inside and let the penguins out of their own accord.

P: And it won't hurt them?

M: It shouldn't! I've never used it on a penguin, but it's fine for humans.

P: Why were you freezing humans...?

<meihappyblush> M: Um. {w=0.25}Lab pranks. 

P: ...

M: ...

P: ...

<meidefault> M: Anyway! It's the best plan we've got so far. What do you think?

P: If you have faith in your ice-gun, sure. Though the penguins will be a lot slipperier if they're encased in ice.

M: Stop being such a butter fingers, then!

N: Before you can reply, she disappears into the back of the craft. You hear thuds and clanks as she tries to find her... what did she call it? Endothermic ray? 

She may not be able to see you, but the need to defend your honour is overpowering.

P: I'm not a butter fingers!

M: Haha! Ice fingers!

N: She reappears with a weird-looking gun in her hand. It has what's clearly a canister of some freezing liquid or gas connected to its body, and a glass sphere at the rear that holds a glowing blue orb of {i}something{/i}.

M: Endothermic ray! I thought about calling it a blaster, but that seemed too violent, no?

P: Sure looks like a gun.

M: Surprisingly, the best method of shooting something is a gun. 

P: Point taken. Will it work?

M: Let's find out!

N: By this point, the penguins have gathered around you again, their long bodies bumping against you as they warble. Mei picks out her target -- a particularly tall male -- aims, and fires a spray of frost that freezes the penguin in seconds.

The ice crackles as it settles, but the bird doesn't move. The others around it shy away, trumpeting with confusion and worry. A female cries at the frozen penguin, and you realize she must be its mate. Oops.

Mei targets the female and freezes her too, then nods at you.

M: Time to give this another try! 

N: Both you and Mei take a penguin and lift. The penguin in your arms -- the male -- is as slippery as you thought he might be, but you manage to get a somewhat-solid grip on him and carry him into the craft's storage compartment.

You set him down as softly as you can, and he slides away to the back of the compartment. You step back to give Mei space, and she slides the female into the compartment, where she clinks against her mate.

Mei dusts her hands off beside you, surveying the remainder of the colony. A metric fucktonne of penguins, and only the two of you to move them. This could take a while.

M: Two down. A thousand more to go. We've got this!

N: You groan.

...

It takes longer than you would like to fill the compartment safely with penguins, stacking the frozen birds atop each other. More remain -- hundreds more -- but you've got your first lot.

You and Mei climb back into the cramped cockpit and she takes off, pushing the craft to its limits across the snow in an effort to reach the Watchpoint before the birds fully thaw.

When you return, she pulls the craft into the garage she brought it out from this morning. You both disembark, and open the rear of the craft. Penguins tumble out, big blobs of bird flopping onto the garage floor.

<<bg>> ECO-WATCHPOINT INTERIOR
      
They wander about, braying in their weird way, and Mei leads them into the Watchpoint proper with kind words. You watch the entire thing with a sense of disbelief. There's no {i}way{/i} this is what's come of your life, right?

And yet, it's really happening. Right in front of you, Mei calms the penguins and introduces them to your current home -- now their home too.

There's something special about Mei, and the birds must sense it too. Why else are they so chilled out when you've essentially just kidnapped them?

Or maybe they're just chill birds anyway.

Still, you can't stop staring as Mei herds the small bundle of birds into the Watchpoint. She's lit up with the joy of actually doing something to help -- and with the happiness that seems to come from her being near cute animals.

She closes the penguins into the Watchpoint, and returns to your side, her cheeks flushed with the effort.

M: Whew! They are a talkative bunch.

P: I think they like you.

<meihappyblush> M: You think so?

P: Yeah. You're pretty cool.

M: Ha! That sounds like you talking, not the penguins.

P: No, no. I can understand them, I speak penguin. They definitely said that. "Mei is cool!" 

M: Where did you learn to speak to penguins?

P: At... penguin school. Which is for penguins.

M: Ah, of course. Penguin school. How could I forget the existence of such a prestigious establishment.

P: I don't know, seems pretty foolish on your part.

M: Well, tell the penguins I said thanks. And tell them I think you -- uh, the penguins are pretty cool themselves. 

P: I'll make a note of it. {w=0.1} Now, shall we go rescue the rest of their friends?

<meihappy> M: Let's!

<<fade>>
TITLE: MEI/DEPLOYMENT ONE/I GUESS THIS IS HAPPENING NOW

BG: ANTARCTICA EXTERIOR 1

      N: With a sun that never sets hanging in the sky, you're not entirely sure what time it is, or how long you and Mei have been carting penguins across the snow. You feel as if you've seen a million of the birds, a never-ending waddle.

But as you pause for a break and look out at the birds, you realise that you're almost finished. Somehow, miraculously, there are only enough penguins left for one more journey back to the Watchpoint. The two of you actually did it.

Mei steps up beside you and puts her hands on her hips, her eyes gleaming as she watches the few remaining penguins toddle around in confusion.

P: Will we need to turn down the Watchpoint's temperature for them?

M: Hmm, not too much. Emperor penguins can regulate their body temperatures pretty well up to 20 degrees Celsius. They're amazing creatures.

I can't believe we're going to have them living with us! What an opportunity to learn about them. Though other scientists might not... approve. 

P: ... yeah. Well, we're doing the best we can.

M: Of course we are! {w=0.1}Oh, and I put in an order for food for them. Let's just say that the Commander is... how shall I put it? Confounded. I think he was hoping you might keep me out of trouble here. 

N: Oh dear. You worry you've failed Commander Morrison, if that's really what he wanted from you. It's not like you knew you'd end up complicit in mass penguin kidnapping! 

Will you get a reprimand when you get back to HQ? Get kicked right out of Overwatch? A thousand bad possibilities run through your head all at once.

But... Mei's a valued Overwatch agent, and from the sounds of things this isn't the first time she's done something, well, odd to complete her mission. She is your mentor here, after all. You're just following her lead.

<meihappy> M: Do you think they'll eventually trust us enough to let me cuddle them?

P: They're still wild animals.

<meigrumpy> M: Yeah... well... they're still cute.

P: Why didn't they bring someone who studied penguins onto this deployment?

<meidefault> M: We may have misjudged what it would entail. Maybe, just a little.

Oh well! You're here, and I'm here, and we'll solve this. I know we will. We're both smart enough to figure this out! {w=0.1}And you need to stop doubting yourself.

N: She grabs your hands and holds them tightly between you both, her face lit up with determination. 

M: We didn't just pluck you out at random. You have a good set of skills that fit in well with the rest of the team. You've got a good heart. Have faith in who you are.

Besides... {w=0.1}<meihappyblush>I think you're pretty cool. I'm glad you're here.

P: Mei...

N: The white world around you seems to disappear, with only you and Mei remaining. You can feel your own cheeks heating up, and you hope it seems like they're red from the cold, like Mei's. 

She looks like she's about to say something, her lips parting slightly, and then --

A honking penguin pushes its way between you both, and the world rushes back into existence. It looks up at you and toots again, as if asking something.

<meidefault> M: Well, go on. Don't you speak penguin?

P: ...

How... are you, penguin...?

N: The penguin twists its neck around to give Mei a look, then with a final gaw the bird wanders off again, seemingly understanding that you are actually useless to it.

Tossing her head back, Mei laughs. You feel a little embarrassed, though you can't quite pinpoint why. All you can do is chuckle along with Mei as you watch the penguin rejoin its remaining friends.

M: I can see you're extensive training in the language of penguins has really paid off. 

P: Must be a different dialect to what I learned.

M: You're the {i}worst{/i} translator I've ever met. Good thing that's not what we hired you for, huh?

M: What?

P: I mean, before we were interrupted. You looked like you were going to say something.

<meihappyblush> M: Oh, no, it's nothing. Don't worry about it.

P: Are you sure? 

M: Positive. Don't worry. <meidefault>We've got more important things to worry about right now.

P: You mean the penguins, right?

M: Yes, I mean the penguins. You are a question machine, did you know that?

P: A question machine?

M: ...

P: ...?

M: Even your silences are questions! How do you do that?

P: I don't know... I didn't realise I did that. Do you want me to stop asking questions?

M: Hehe, no. I don't want to crush anyone's curiosity, especially not when I'm supposed to be their mentor, or whatever the Commander's intends me to be. You can keep being a question machine.

P: So I can keep asking questions?

M: {i}Sigh.{/i} Yes, you can keep asking questions. 

P: ...

M: Yes?

P: No, it's okay. I've run out of questions.

M: That's a first.

P: Is it?

N: Mei rolls her eyes and pulls her freeze-ray from its holster. You take a hesitant step backwards.

M: I'm not going to freeze {i}you{/i}, silly. Not yet, at least.

P: Whew. {w=0.25}Wait... not yet?

N: She winks at you, then heads off towards the penguins with her endothermic-whatever-it-is. You follow along behind at a fair distance, refraining from thinking anything with a question mark.
      
///SECOND CHOICE///

      P: I'm glad I'm here, too.

M: What?

P: Before, you said you were glad I'm here. I'm glad too. 

<meihappy> M: Not many people would help me with something like this. {i}"Mei, this plan doesn't make any sense." "Mei, this is a terrible idea."{/i} That's what they'd say. Not you, though. You're different.

P: I don't know how anyone could say no to a face like yours.

M: Sucking up to me won't get you a better post-deployment review, you know!

P: That's -- That's not -- I'm not -- 

M: Haha! I know you're not like that.

P: How? You barely know me.

M: I think after a day of penguin-hauling you get to know someone pretty well. Besides, I've always been good at reading people. It's been a skill that's helped me a lot in my time at Overwatch.

You need to know if someone's going to be able to really help you, or if they'll just become a threat or a liability to your mission. That way you can fix things before they become problems.

Otherwise, you end up with teammates who get scared and back out of something when you need them the most. I try to avoid that. {w=0.1}But then... I don't often work with a team.

P: You're usually alone?

<meiworried> M: Less people to get hurt if something goes wrong. It's not that I don't like being around people... I don't want to be the reason they get hurt.

P: You know that if someone makes a choice that harms them, it's not your fault.

M: It feels like it is when you're in command of a deployment.

P: Oh...

N: You struggle to find the right words to help reassure Mei, never having been in that position yourself. Does she worry about you getting hurt under her watch? You wish she wouldn't -- you are prone to hurting yourself, after all.

P: You don't have to worry about me. 

M: ...

P: Okay?

M: ...

Okay.

P: Good. Now, let's get these last few penguins so we can get home and grab something warm to eat.

<meidefault> M: Sounds like a good plan.

N: As you start towards the penguins, you hear the sounds of Mei freeing her freeze gun -- endothermic ray, rather -- from its holster. She catches up to you quickly, looking all kinds of heroic with the way she shines in the sun. 
      
///THIRD CHOICE///

      P: You can still find someone better suited to the job, you know.

M: What, penguin translator?

P: I meant in general. This whole deployment.

M: What did I just say about having faith in yourself?

P: That I need to have it...?

M: Exactly! You need to be chill when it comes to this kind of thing. If you stress out, everything suddenly gets harder and you make a lot more mistakes. Just go with the flow, believe in what you're doing.

It's not always easy, but you have to try. You might find things a lot easier to deal with when you figure it out. 

So you'll try, right?

N: You think of your entire life before this deployment, of how much you stressed out when preparing for exams and tests because you wanted to do as well as possible. Did that stress and anxiety ever help you? You're not actually sure.

Being more like Mei doesn't seem like a bad thing, though. She seems so calm and in control, even after struggling to transport penguins by the wing-load. 

P: Yeah, I'll try.

M: Good. <meihappy>No point getting worried about things now, we're both here. It's settled and I'm not going to trade you out for someone else. Especially not now.

P: Aye-aye, Cap'n. 

M: Damn it {$PlayerName}, I'm a scientist, not a pirate.

P: Aye-aye, Doc. I promise I'll stop asking if you're sure you want me here.

<meidefault> M: And promise you'll stop thinking about it, too. Or at least try to stop.

N: You're not actually sure you {i}can{/i} promise that, at least not for a while yet. But Mei seems so determined to have you believe in your worth, and you suppose if she has faith in you, you can at least believe in that.

P: I'll try. Thank you.

M: Of course! Everyone needs someone to boost their confidence every now and again, and I don't think the penguins are going to help you with that. 

P: It's true, emperors are not known for their encouraging ways. Historically, they've kinda been jerks.

M: Haha! You're not wrong.

P: Speaking of the emperors... Should we get these Royal Majesties to the Watchpoint?

M: Imperial Majesties, actually. 

P: My mistake! I wouldn't want to offend such esteemed royalty, now would I?

M: You know how those monarchs are.

P: They sure are a...{w=0.1} {i}royal{/i} pain in my ass.

N: Mei shakes her head with a laugh and unholsters her endothermic ray. Her intention is clear: it's time to get back to business.
      


      N: You and Mei work your way through the last few penguins, her freezing and you both carrying the frozen birds over to the craft. They really do just seem completely resigned. Like, "okay, these weird penguins are taking us somewhere."

The last penguin even walks right up to you, braying plaintively as if asking to be taken to its friends and family. The poor thing looks so lost, you can't stop yourself trying to reassure it.

P: Hey, you'll be with everyone else soon. Don't worry. We won't hurt you.

N: The bird meets your eyes with its own, and you think for a moment that it understands you. 

Then there's a {i}whoosh{/i} and the penguin freezes over. You bend your knees and wrap your arms around it, careful to get as good a grip as you can, then stand to head back to the craft.

You slide the penguin into the back with the rest. They look like strange, icy statues as they are, as if some master carver had come along and created them from the ice and snow of Antarctica.

Closing the compartment, you heave a thankful sigh. You thought your body was unhappy with you yesterday, but today it feels like it might just up and completely rebel against you. Your muscles seem to groan with every movement.

Hopefully, tomorrow won't have anywhere near as much heavy lifting or walking. It would be nice to just sit down for the day and maybe eat the entire time. That would almost be like heaven.

In your mind's eye, you see the table in the kitchen stacked with all sorts of hot, delicious foods. Ramen, roast chicken, stuffed capsicum, heaped pancakes, everything you can possibly imagine.

M: Come back to Earth, {$PlayerName}!

Mei claps you on the shoulder, and you jerk out of your fantasy. At the corner of your mouth you feel a bit of frozen drool, and you blush as you wipe it away. Oops.

M: Feeling a little hungry? I could hear your stomach rumbling.

P: Maybe a little.

M: I've got good news for you, then: we're all done here! 

P: That {i}is{/i} good news.

N: Mei closes the door of the rear compartment, locking it so that it can't accidentally fly open during the trip home. Putting her hands on her hips, she takes one last, long look at the area.

The snow is a mess, disturbed by not just the two of you, but also all the penguins. It's also coloured by, well... it's not like the penguins exactly have toilets out here. You try not to think about that too much.

It's definitely not even close to being a pristine wonderland right here, but it's evidence of life and hard work. Something about that feels good to you... once you get past the smell, at least.

Mei turns to you, grinning, with a block of chocolate in her hand. Breaking off a piece, she hands it to you without words. You take the piece and pop it between your lips, letting the heat of your mouth melt it slowly.

Is there anything better than a good piece of chocolate after a long day of work? You highly doubt it. Thousands of studies could be done, and maybe the only other thing that will come close is being buried in kittens.

Or... your eyes dart to Mei. Her own eyes are closed as she luxuriates in the taste of the chocolate dissolving on her tongue. 

Your heart starts to beat just a little faster as you take in the details of her face -- probably just the sugar kicking in. No doubt your blood sugar is low, right?

You feel your face heat up and you quickly avert your gaze, waiting in companionable silence as you both suck on your respective squares of chocolate.

M: It's really something out here, isn't it?

      ///CONSEQUENTIAL CHOICE///

      FIRST CHOICE <approval +1>: It's beautiful.
SECOND CHOICE <approval +0.5>: Not next to you.
      
///FIRST CHOICE///

      P: Yeah. Beautiful.

M: Do you think that if everyone could see this, they'd want to save the environment even more? How can you see a view like this and think the planet isn't important?

P: Maybe they would. I can't imagine not being awed by this landscape, and by all the penguins. It's... not something you can capture with documentaries. 

M: Seeing things on screens changes them. That's why so many people don't actually understand how beautiful and dangerous the planet and its environments can be. Everything's so much bigger in the real world.

But it's not like we'd want people to come visit here, I guess. They'd just cause more damage. Tourists aren't necessarily the most considerate visitors to at-risk environments, or endangered species. 

<meiworried> It makes me sad. So many people just aren't ever going to know.

N: Her eyebrows draw together as she crosses her arms. Lowering her head, she sighs. You wish you knew something you could do to comfort her, like a hug. But you're not sure you know her well enough for that, so you stay back.

P: You know. And I know. And we both care. That's something, isn't it?

N: She looks up at you, her eyes swimming with sadness and worry behind her glasses. Tucking a strand of hair behind her ears, she smiles slightly.

<meidefault> M: You're right. That is something! 

We're in a position to help Antarctica and the penguins! Thank you for reminding me of that. Sometimes it's hard not to get caught up in how much more I wish everyone could be doing.

      	///INCONSEQUENTIAL CHOICE///

      	FIRST CHOICE: I know what you mean.
	SECOND CHOICE: I don't really get that.
      
	///FIRST CHOICE///

      	P: I know what you mean. That happens to me, too.

	M: I'm glad I'm not alone, then. We'll have to make sure neither of us fall into that kind of thinking! We have to be positive about what we're doing, or else it's far too easy to lose our ways.

	P: Yeah, definitely.

	M: Especially when it's only us and miles of snow. We've only got each other to rely on. 

	I know I can rely on you, though. You understand how it feels to want to save the planet, and I know I can trust you.

	P: Thank you. I won't let you down.

	M: I know you won't. 
      	
	///SECOND CHOICE///

      	P: I don't really know that feeling. I'm sorry.

	M: It's okay, I don't expect you to. I think it's kind of a me thing. I probably just think too much. 

	<meihappyblush>Aah, sorry for over-sharing, I didn't mean to bring down the conversation like that!

	P: What?! You don't have to apologize, especially for anything like that!

	M: Thank you. {w=0.1}I really feel like I can talk to you so easily. I haven't met many people like that before.

	P: Me?

	M: Yes, haha! You! Never mind, it's silly.

	P: I don't think it's silly. It might be a bit... {i}chilly{/i} though. {w=0.1}

	No, that was just bad

	<meihappy>M: That was terrible.

	P: Let's just forget that happened.
      
	

///SECOND CHOICE///

      P: Not really. I mean, just look at the mess those penguins made. It's not exactly picturesque.

M: You do know they'll be making this same mess in the Watchpoint, right?

P: ... so who's on cleaning duty?

M: It's fine, I'll whip up something that can clean the floors for us. {w=0.25}I can't believe you're not impressed by this view.

P: I meant that compared to you, it's not much. 

<meihappyblush> M: That's very nice, but next to nature I don't think any human really compares. Let alone me! I mean...

N: She sweeps her arms in a wide gesture, seemingly unable to word her thoughts. You get the gist of it though, because despite the dirty snow, the rest is still damn nice.

M: You know?

      	///INCONSEQUENTIAL CHOICE///

      	FIRST CHOICE: What if you fell in love?
	SECOND CHOICE: Still doesn't compare to you.
      
	///FIRST CHOICE///

      	P: I feel sorry for any suitors vying for your attention. They're up against a whole planet!

	<meihappyblush> M: Haha! Hahaha! You're funny. I don't have any suitors.

	P: I can't believe that.

	<meidefault> M: You're going to have to, because it's true. Where are {i}your{/i} suitors?

	P: I... uh, don't have any.

	M: Now I don't believe that! I think we're going to have to agree to disagree here.

	P: ... fine.

	M: And even if I did have any, I'm way too busy for love. There's a whole world out here for me to save.

	P: Even heroes need a break sometimes, especially those as hardworking as you. You don't even think about falling in love?

	N: Her face takes on a dreamy look as she ponders your question, as if she's gazing into another world invisible to you. {w=0.25}She looks at you, and a small smile forms upon her lips, blooming like a bright flower in spring.

	M: ...
	
	Maybe one day. It would be nice, wouldn't it?

	P: Yeah, it would be.
      
	///SECOND CHOICE///

      	P: I still think you're the best view here.

	<meihappyblush> M: Haha! Stop! You're being ridiculous.

	P: I'm sorry, I don't want to make you uncomfortable. I'll stop if you want.

	M: You're not making me uncomfortable. I'm just...

	P: You're just...?

	M: It's a very nice compliment. Thank you. You're very sweet. 

	P: I'm only being honest.

	M: Well, your honesty is sweet, then. That's one of the nicest things anyone's ever said to me.

	P: I mean it whole-heartedly.

	N: Mei smiles widely at you, blushing about as much as you feel you are. How can it be possible, you wonder, that nobody else has said anything as sweet to her? She definitely deserves the kindness.

	In fact, you're not sure you've ever met anyone as deserving of kind words as Mei. It can't be only you who can see it, right?
      
	



      <meidefault> M: We did good work here today, {$PlayerName}. Time to head home before we freeze to death.

N: Mei climbs into the craft's cockpit, and you quickly follow her. The cold is definitely getting to you now, you're not sure you can feel your toes anymore. 

Though, now that you think about it, you're not sure you ever actually feel your toes. You're at least sure that right now, they're very cold. Your nose, too.

After this mission is done, you think you might ask for a deployment somewhere warmer. Fiji, maybe. Surely there's some pending environmental disaster that requires you in the tropics. As long as Mei's in.

Hot air blasts from the cockpit's heaters, and you revel in the warmth. On your mind is the shower back at the Watchpoint, which you will absolutely spend far too long in when you return. 

P: If this killer cold is good for anything, it's making me appreciate how much I enjoy warmth.

M: The same could be said for any bad thing. The lows help you enjoy the highs much more. Having a bad week? Your next good day will feel even brighter afterward! 

P: And a bad salad makes you appreciate a good dessert a lot more.

M: Haha, yes. Exactly like that.

P: I've never thought about it like that before.

M: That's how I look at anything I have to go through that's hard. Like this mission. It's been a lot of hard work to get the penguins to the Watchpoint, and it'll be a lot more to figure out what's wrong.

But once we've solved what's happening and fixed it for the penguins, we'll feel so much more accomplished. It's one of the best feelings in the world, helping those who need it even if it's difficult for you at the time.

P: How are you such a good person?

M: I'm not sure I'm a good person, but I do try my hardest to be the best I can be! I don't see the point of living any other way.

I think everyone should do the best they can all the time, then we can all help to make humanity the best {i}it{/i} can be!

P: That's what Overwatch is here for, right? Doing the best it can to help everyone.

M: Yes, exactly. That's why Overwatch and all it stands for is so important. If people have their heroes like Tracer and Winston to look up to, then maybe they'll strive to become good people too. At least, that's what I believe.

Maybe they might even look up to me and want to help save the planet's environment! That would be nice, I think.

P: I can't imagine anyone looking up to me.

M: Why not?

P: I'm just an oceanographer. Next to people like you and Tracer, I'm no hero. I'm just trying my best.

M: And that's exactly what you should be doing! It shouldn't matter if you're a world-renowned hero or "just" and oceanographer. You're doing the best you can, and {i}that{/i} is what matters.

Besides, saving the penguins would definitely be heroic. Don't write yourself off yet. One day people will look up to you, I know it.

P: Oh shush, you're gonna make me blush.

<meihappy> M: That's the idea! Haha!

N: Mei continues talking, but already you can feel the world drifting away into darkness, your eyelids too heavy to fight. It'll take a while to get back to the Watchpoint from here, surely long enough for a nap.

Her words fade into a soft, rhythmic sound without meaning. You feel bad that you're not actually listening to her, but the warmth has lulled you into a state of total blissed-out sleepiness that you don't have the energy to tell her.

Besides, her voice is nice to listen to{w=0.1}.{w=0.1}.{w=0.1}.

TITLE: ECO WATCHPOINT INTERIOR
BG: ECO-WATCHPOINT INTERIOR


      N: {i}Clang!{/i}

You startle awake suddenly, awoken by a loud clatter from nearby. The world has become black and white, and the floor seems to be moving and wriggling. Have you gone colourblind from the cold? Are you dreaming? Hallucinating?

You rub your eyes and realise that actually, you are just surrounded by penguins. Of {i}course{/i} you are.

It takes a moment to notice that you're back in the Watchpoint instead of the cramped snowcraft. How you got back inside without noticing is a mystery to you.

From the smells and sounds emanating from the kitchen, you figure Mei is making food. No doubt she was the cause of the sound that jolted you from your now-faded dreams. That, or a penguin messing with something it shouldn't be touching.

You push yourself up from your seat and make your way through the penguins and into the kitchen, where Mei hovers over the stove. Looking up at you, she smiles.

M: Hey, sleepyhead. Hungry? Just kidding, I know you are!

P: Smells good.

N: The penguins in the kitchen seem to swarm around Mei, hampering any attempts on her part to move around. They gak at the stove, as if they know there is food being cooked and they're asking for some too.

M: So I have some good news, and I have some bad news.
      
      P: Oh boy.

      ///VARIABLE/// 

If $BrokenDoor is true:

      M: The good news is that the penguins have settled in better than I expected, {i}and{/i} that there are no penguins in my room.

P: ...and the bad?

<meiworried> M: There are penguins in your room.

P: How?! What?!

M: So it turns out your room's locking mechanism is broken, which means the door can't be closed properly. The penguins figured that out pretty quickly.

P: Ugh... 

<meihappyblush> M: I'm sorry. Guess you'll be sharing a bit more than you expected.

P: I just hope they're respectful roommates.

M: Sorry! Sorry. Hopefully they'll be gone soon.

      If $BrokenDoor is false:
      
M: The good news is that the penguins have settled in better than I expected. Even better news for you: there are no penguins in your room!

P: That's great news! {w=0,25}Wait, my room?

M: The bad news is my door is broken. It seems that some of the penguins have decided to bunk with me.

P: Hmm, that's not the best news.

M: That's what I get for letting {i}you{/i} choose, huh?

P: We can swap rooms, if you want.

M: No, it's fine. I don't mind sharing with these cuties. Besides, they shouldn't be here long anyway.

P: You sure?

M: I'm sure! Don't you worry about it. 

      

      P: This is only the first day.

<meihappy> M: What next? An orca guard-dog? {w=0.1}Though... hmm, more of a guard-whale, I guess. 

P: I think I might draw the line at orcas. 

M: What about a sealion?

P: I might consider a sealion.

M: I know what I'm bringing home tomorrow, then.

P: Uh oh.

N: You grin at her, but then something occurs to you. She must notice the way your face changes, because she frowns inquisitively.

M: What is it?

P: If the penguins won't go into the ocean, maybe it's nothing to do with the penguins themselves. Maybe there's something wrong with the ocean.

<meisurprise> M: Oh! Oh, you might be onto something there! I can't believe I didn't think of that. <meidefault> That means we're going to need some things to run tests on the water, and maybe the other animals in the water...

N: She trails off, muttering to herself about experiments and equipment you're both going to need to follow up on your idea. You're just happy she likes your suggestion.

Then, she pauses, and smiles at you.

<meihappy> M: By the way, I've decided to give us tomorrow off. We deserve a break day.

P: Does that mean I can sleep in?

M: Of course.

P: Yes!

N: She laughs, serving the food up as she does. Fighting through the penguin horde, she hands you a warm bowl filled with something that smells delicious. You're not sure what's in it, but you're too hungry to ask more questions.

You and Mei settle down with your dinner, chatting the rest of your still-sunlit evening away as you eat. You feel good, the best you have in months. Finally, you feel like you're doing something that matters.

Mei smiles warmly at you and your heart flutters in your chest. 

What could the rest of this mission bring...?

Probably nothing interesting.

      N: You step into the kitchen, which is, typically, filled with penguins. No matter where you turn, they are there waiting for you. You think the Watchpoint is your home? No. It belongs to the penguins now. You're {i}their{/i} guest.

You pick a path through the birds to the cupboard, only to find it open and the food stored on the lower shelves stolen. Who could the culprit be?

Oh yeah. {i}Penguins.{/i}

The birds nearest you look up with guilt in their little eyes, torn food packaging at their feet. They know what they've done.


      ///CONSEQUENTIAL CHOICE///

      FIRST CHOICE <approval -1.5>: Chase the penguins out.
SECOND CHOICE <approval +1>: Feed the penguins more.
      
///FIRST CHOICE///

      N: You're too hungry to deal with their shit right now, though. How are you supposed to eat in peace with all of them watching you, knowing they're likely planning a coup right at this moment to steal all the food?

Okay, you think that might be a bit too far-fetched. But you can't deny that's what you'd be doing if you were in their place. There's only one thing for it, then: getting the penguins out of the kitchen.

It seems easy in theory, but you remember how hard it was to get the penguins to the Watchpoint in the first place. This will require all your wits and skills if you want to succeed. 

...

You flap your arms and squawk at the birds, informing them that this is your space, and they need to leave -- or at least, that's what you're hoping to tell them. 

The penguins in the kitchen all look up at you, and for a moment you think they might have gotten the message. Then, one by one, they all go back to what they were doing before: literally nothing. Useless layabouts.

A couple of the birds honk at you, probably saying that you look like a damn fool, and why are you embarrassing yourself like this? 

A good question.

You've been told before that when diplomacy fails, force is the next logical step. Negotiating with these birds is clearly doomed for failure, considering the massive language barrier and their outright refusal to listen to you.

You roll up your sleeves and push at the penguins near you, not violently, but not softly either. They gak in response, shuffling their weird little feet against the floor to right themselves and push back against you.

They huddle together into a group, giving you offended looks as you try to slide them out of the kitchen. In barely no time at all you're hot and huffing, and the penguins have barely moved.

In fact, more have squeezed their way into the kitchen. They seem curious about the fuss you're causing, judging your feeble attempts at clearing some space.

You didn't ever think you'd be judged by a penguin, but here you are.

Taking a break to lean against the bench, you realise that force is not going to work. You may be bigger and stronger, but there are a lot more penguins than there are you.

You only have one more option left to you...{w=0.1} annoying the penguins away. A method proven to be effective many times throughout history. You only hope it doesn't fail you now.

It doesn't take you long to source a saucepan and a large spoon. The birds crowd around you inquisitively, and you have to hold the saucepan above their head to stop them tapping their beaks against it.

You raise the pan over your head, preparing yourself. Then, you bring the spoon against the metal pan with as much strength as you can.

{i}CLANG!{/i}

The sound echoes through the kitchen and, you assume, the rest of the Watchpoint. The birds jump away from you and the loud noise, voicing their displeasure in your direction.

You continue hitting the spoon against the pan. {i}CLANG! CLANG! CLANGCLANGCLANGCLANG!{/i}

Braying, the birds waddle their way away from the one-person cacophony that is you and your makeshift instruments. 

{/i}Yes!{/i}

You taste sweet victory as you watch the penguins escape the kitchen, feeling powerful at having succeeded.

Then, the penguins part, and Mei enters the room. The pan and spoon drop from your hands, hitting the floor with a clatter.

<meigrumpy> She puts her hands on her hips and frowns at you. Her eyes flash, and you know you're in trouble. This is the end for you. She's going to kill you and feed you to the penguins, isn't she?

M: ...

P: ...

M: What do you think you're doing?

P: ... making noise.

M: Why?

P: ... I was trying to chase the penguins out.

M: By scaring them? What in the world made you think that was a good idea?

P: I tried to ask nicely...

M: ...

N: You bow your head, only hoping that Mei is merciful when angry. No doubt she is the patron god of penguins, and you have wronged the poor birds. 

P: I'm sorry.

M: Are you really?

P: Yes, I swear!

M: You shouldn't be apologizing to me, then.

P: What?

N: She spreads her arms, gesturing at the birds that have huddled around her. Instantly, you know what she's about to tell you to do.

M: Apologize to them.

P: But they're birds.

M: Apologize. To. The. Penguins.

N: This is ridiculous, right? She can't possibly expect you to actually apologize to animals who can't even understand the words "I'm sorry." 

But she continues staring at you with the same hard look, her fists planted firmly back on her hips. You know that at this moment you have accidentally stumbled upon the icy part of her heart. 

P: ... I'm sorry, penguins.

N: Your mumbling seems to meet deaf ears, and neither Mei nor the penguins drop their cold glares. She raises her eyebrows at you, unamused.

M: I don't think they all heard you.

P: Fine. I'm sorry, penguins! I shouldn't have tried to chase you out.

N: The penguins seem to accept your apology this time, waddling back to their claimed spaces in the kitchen. <meidefault> Mei drops her hands, nodding acceptance. You breathe a sigh of relief, feeling the icy atmosphere slowly return to normal.

M: Good, I'm sure you won't distress the penguins anymore, right?

P: Right. I promise.

M: Sorry for getting so mad. But you shouldn't have done that.

P: I know.

M: Good. I'm watching you.

N: She points two fingers at her eyes, then swings them around to point at yours. You get her message loud and clear.

Without another word, she turns on her heels and disappears back where she came from. The penguins fill the gap where she stood, giving you the kind of look you imagine a smug young sibling might.

Frustrated, but still hungry, you grab a couple protein bars and stalk out of the kitchen. Damn penguins.
      
///SECOND CHOICE///
      
N: You can't bring yourself to blame them, though. How hungry must the poor things be? Wouldn't you do the same thing if you were in their place? You can't imagine not eating for a whole day, let alone weeks at a time.

You're suddenly very thankful you're not a penguin. You're also thankful the penguins can't reach higher than their own heads, or else you might {i}have{/i} to go without eating for a while.

The birds stare at you plaintively and you feel your heart melt. How can you even consider making yourself food in front of them, when they must be starving? 

You dig around in the cupboard, looking for food you think the penguins might like. Unsurprisingly, there's no fish, squid, or krill to be found anywhere. Just the packaged meals meant for human consumption.

You suppose they'll just have to deal. They already ate whatever was stored lower down, anyway. They're probably not picky right now.

You grab packages of food arbitrarily, throwing them onto the counter with barely a look at their labels. After creating a sizeable pile, you push through the throng to the food and begin opening packets, emptying the contents.

As you drop food to the floor, you make your way around the kitchen in a loop to allow more penguins to access whatever random meals you've spilled for them. You see something that looks like scrambled eggs in the mix. {i}Eugh.{/i}

P: Eat up! 

N: The penguins barely hesitate before ducking their heads down to investigate. It's not long until the curious few begin chomping away, prompting their fellow birds to join them. 

Soon enough, the kitchen is filled with penguins vying for a bite to eat. You quickly realise there's no more space for you, and no way to escape the mass of feathers and blubber filling the room.

You climb onto the bench and stand, surveying the kitchen as if a benevolent dictator watching over {$Possessive} kingdom. For your first day as penguin-leader, you think you're not doing too bad.

As long as you don't think too hard about the fact that you forgot to grab a snack for yourself before climbing up here. You have no idea how long you'll be stuck on this bench, waiting for the birds to finish and disperse.

Something occurs to you suddenly: the thought that maybe feeding the penguins this much {i}wasn't{/i} such a good idea, after all. You and Mei only have a finite amount of food, and you personally have no clue when the next shipment is.

The penguins can survive longer without food than the two humans residing within the Watchpoint. What if you've just doomed Mei and yourself? Will someone have to resort to cannibalism? 

You're not sure you could bring yourself to that.

Maybe you can learn how to icefish. You could catch some real, fresh meals for dinner, and impress Mei while you're at it.

... on second thought, you're more likely to slip on the ice and fall through into the cold water below. You don't even know how to fish {i}normally{/i}.

You sit down, crossing your legs and making yourself as comfortable as possible while you wait out your accidental isolation. The penguins looks so happy to you that even if you have just made a mistake, it feels worth it.

Penguins wiggle away from the kitchen entrance, and you turn your head to see Mei standing at the edge of the hungry horde. <meidefault> Her eyes sparkle as she takes in the view, and then she looks at you.

<meihappy> M: Haha! What have you done?

P: I fed the penguins. They looked hungry.

M: Are you stuck?

N: You feel embarrassed to admit it, not wanting to appear as if you don't think your plans through.

Even though you clearly don't.

P: No, I just like sitting.

M: On kitchen benches?

P: Yeah. What, you {i}don't{/i} like sitting on benches?

N: She rolls her eyes, obviously not convinced. You can't possibly understand why, your lying skills are stellar and your story totally checks out. Maybe you just like being tall. Who is she to judge?

Oh yeah, your supervising officer. 

<meidefault> M: Is this our food they're eating?

P: Uh, yes.

N: Her eyes dark to the half-open cupboard, and she crosses her arms. Here it comes: The Lecture.

M: You didn't give them everything, right?

P: Of course not! But they also stole a lot of their own. So not all of that is my fault.

N: She sighs and makes her way to the cupboard. Though the penguins refused to move for you, they easily make space for Mei to pass. No doubt about who the favourite is here.

She rifles through the food inside, mumbling to herself quietly as she checks everything over. When she turns back to you, her shoulders look much more relaxed.

M: We definitely have enough food to last until the next shipment. Assuming you don't go feeding the penguins the rest.

P: I won't, I'm sorry.

<meisurprise> M: Oh! No! <meidefault> I'm sorry, I didn't mean that as a bad thing. I think this was so nice of you to do. Especially when I know you love eating so much.

P: I just couldn't bear the way they looked at me. I couldn't imagine being so hungry.

<meihappy> M: You're so sweet. I'm sure they appreciate it.

N: She pats your shoulder and moves as if to leave, picking her path through the crowding birds.

P: Wait!

<meidefault> M: Hmm?

P: Uh... could you help me out of here?

<meihappy> M: I knew it! Haha! You're totally stuck.

P: Look,

M: I am looking. At you stuck on the bench.

P: Please?

M: Of course.

N: She puts her arms around you and picks you up as if you weigh nothing at all. For a moment, you think she's going to throw you over her shoulder, but instead she cradles you like the big baby you are.

P: I wouldn't want to arm wrestle you.

<meihappyblush> M: Oh, I'm the worst at arm wrestling. You'd definitely win.

P: Pffft. Why do I doubt that?

N: She just smiles at you, before setting you back on your feet at the edge of the penguin crush. On the opposite side to the pantry. Where the food is.

M: I have to get back to some things. Have fun with your new friends, {$PlayerName}!

P: See ya.

N: She gives you a little wave and heads off elsewhere. The heroic climatologist, off to save another useless person from their own bad decisions.

Oh, right. You're the only person on this continent that fits that description.

Mei's probably off doing something actually useful, then.

Your stomach grumbles, and you gaze longingly at the cupboard across what seems like an infinite sea of penguins.

Damn it.

TITLE: MEI/SHORE LEAVE 1/CLIMATE LAB

BG: KITCHEN


      N: The moment you enter the climate lab, you feel the temperature drop. Not so cold that you can see your breath, but cold enough that you gather your clothes closer to you as you move further inside.

Scattered around the place is the equipment you helped Mei carry inside, most of it unidentifiable to you though some devices are at least familiar. 

There are also penguins, because of course there are. They all seemed pretty chilled out, no doubt a result of finding the coldest room in the Watchpoint. 

You see Mei working at a desk, a device gutted before her. She doesn't seem to have noticed your entry, she's so sucked into whatever she's working on.

      ///INCONSEQUENTIAL CHOICE///

      FIRST CHOICE: Approach Mei <approval +0.5>.
SECOND CHOICE: Leave Mei alone.

      ///FIRST CHOICE///

      N: You approach Mei, wishing somewhat that you'd brought a jacket in here with you. You know Mei likes the cold, but you weren't expecting {i}this.{/i}

<meigrumpy> As you get closer to Mei, you can see the frustration in her stance and her actions. Hunched shoulders, pouted lips, 

You stand right beside her, and she still doesn't seem to notice you.

M: ... stupid thing... 

P: Whatcha doing there?

N: She nearly leaps right out of her skin, squeaking in surprise as she smacks her hand right into your face. {i}SLAP!{/i}

<meisurprise> M: Ahhhh!

P: Ahhhh!

M: Aaaaooohhh... it's you. <meihappyblush>

N: You can't help but give her a hurt look as you rub your stinging nose. She, rightfully, looks apologetic and embarrassed. 

M: Sorry! Sorry! I'm sorry!

P: It's fine.

M: I didn't realise you were there, you totally snuck up on me!

P: You were very involved in... whatever you're working on.

N: She looks down at the device lying in pieces on the table and scratches her head. Even now, upon closer inspection, you have no idea what this thing might be.

M: I guess so.

P: What is this object that has captured your attention so?

M: Hmm. Something I'm working on to scan water for potentially dangerous substances. For when we head out next.

P: Sounds interesting! How does it work?

<meihappy> N: She brightens suddenly, all sense of embarrassment fading, and launches into an explanation filled with terms you don't understand at all. You can tell she's saying words, but she might as well be speaking another language.

You smile and nod as she gestures animatedly, hoping she won't ask you any questions when she's finished.

You kind of regret asking her the question.

M: What do you think?

P: Uh...

N: As she watches you, you search for something smart to say.

P: Sounds like you know what you're doing.

M: I'm glad someone thinks so. If only this thing would agree with you...

P: Have you tried hitting it?

<meidefault> M: What?

P: That's what I do when things aren't working.

M: And... does that work?

P: Sometimes.

M: ...

...

... I might try that.

P: Good luck! I don't think I can be much more help than that.

M: You had no clue what I was talking about, did you?

P: ... no.

<meihappy> M: Well, you're sweet to listen anyway! You didn't have to do that.

P: But you looked so excited about it all. I didn't want to ruin that.

M: Awww! You're such a sweetie! 

<meidefault> But for real, you can go now. You're very distracting.

P: Distracting?

M: Yes.

P: You're worried I'm going to trip and knock everything away, aren't you?

M: Yes.

N: You can't blame her for worrying about that, it {i}is{/i} very much something you would do, after all. No point staying here if you're just going to get in her way. It's not like you know anything about her equipment.

P: Okay, but if you need anything just ask.

N: Turning back to her work, she waves a hand at you.

M: Mhmm, sure, of course.

P: Why do I get the feeling you won't need me for anything? 

M: Go have fun with the penguins!

P: Yeah, yeah. Good luck with your... ocean-checker.

N: She laughs, but says nothing more, and you have no choice but to leave or else risk hanging around creepily. You turn to leave, waving at her despite her not looking at you.

As you leave the lab, you hear a {i}thunk{/i} that sounds awfully like someone hitting a stubborn piece of technology.

      ///SECOND CHOICE///

      N: You stare at Mei for a few minutes, debating whether or not to disturb her as she works. On one hand: you get to talk to Mei. On the other: she look awfully busy.

The penguins watch you cautiously as you stand there awkwardly, trying to decide on what your next course of action should be. If only you could stop being such an over-thinker.

...

Best to leave her be. You remember how much you hate it when someone distracts you while you're in the zone, and this definitely seems like Mei's zone. You don't want to ruin that for her.

You turn back the way you came and leave.

TITLE: MEI/SHORE LEAVE 1/REC ROOM

BG: KITCHEN


      N: Looking for a little R&R, you make your way to the recreation room. Upon arrival, however, you discover it's actually lacking a lot of recreational activities. 

A post-it note stuck to the wall nearby catches your eyes. You approach it and read over the short, scribbled message.

{i}Sorry, forgot to order some things for the room. Remind me to stock when more agents move in. -- Morrison{/i}

So, looks like the Commander isn't infallible after all. This information warms you, until you remember that you wanted to do something fun and not just stand amongst the penguins like a loser.

And yes, there are penguins here. Aren't they everywhere, now? You feel like you'll probably be dreaming about them tonight. They will invade every facet of your life until you yourself become a penguin.

Which might not be so bad, you decide. At least penguins don't have to worry about half-empty recreation rooms. They can slide anywhere on their stomachs. They are, thanks to evolution, able to have fun anywhere they go.

There's a treadmill against one wall, and really, what else is there to do? You guess you could read some books, or something.

      ///INCONSEQUENTIAL CHOICE///

      FIRST CHOICE: Run for a while.
SECOND CHOICE: Read a book.

      ///FIRST CHOICE///

      N: You head to the treadmill and switch it on. After a while, you warm up to the rhythm of the machine and feel pretty badass as you run.

A few penguins gather around the machine curiously, their heads whipping back and forth as they watch the track fly past. 

For a moment, as you realise what's about to happen next, time seems to slow. But there's nothing you can do.

One of the penguins flops onto the track, ready to slide along the treadmill as it goes. The penguin sure slides down the track{w=0.1}, right into your feet.
 
You and the penguin go flying off the end of the treadmill, into a pile of more penguins. The birds honk with shock and indignation, and all you can do is lie among them as the world spins and regret every choice that lead you here.

The penguin that tumbled off the machine with you wriggles off of your stomach and waddles away from both you and the treadmill, likely done with exercise for the day.

You get up and switch the treadmill off. You're pretty done with exercise for the day too.

      ///SECOND CHOICE///

      N: Yikes, exercise. Not today. No thanks.

You instead grab a fun-looking book from the shelf and settle down onto a couch. It's not something you've read before, but you're sure you've heard of it. The Malnutrition Matches. Yeah, you've definitely heard of it.

...

...

About a third of the way through the book, you realise this is a less-than-fun story. Maybe the Malnutrition in the title should've alerted you to that. 

When you look up from the book, you notice that as you've read, you've been surrounded by penguins who have made their way onto the couch too. Somehow, without realising, you became part of a big penguin cuddle-pile.

{i}Hmm.{/i}

With a shrug, you return to your book.
