TITLE: MEI/DEPLOYMENT ONE/SO YOU LIKE FISH
      
BG: Overwatch HQ (same as intro)
      
N: You lower the pad and hand it back to the Commander, watching his face intently. Why do they want an oceanographer? What possible use could your knowledge be to the almighty Overwatch?

His face doesn't change as he looks over your information.

J: So you like... fish?

N: You don't know what to make of this question. You suppose you like fish, but there are many different kinds, and some are definitely worse than others.

P: I mean, it depends on the fish. I like cuttlefish, but flounder kind of freak me out. And clownfish are on a whole other level.

He just stares at you. 

{i}Oh no, I said something wrong.{i}

Maybe he doesn't like fish. Maybe they didn't need an oceanographer anyway, and they called in the wrong person. {i}"Sorry, sorry, wrong number. We'll send you on your way now."{i}

He smirks. This is it. You're about to get the boot. Or... {w=0.25}do they even let people leave here alive? Maybe you already know too much. Maybe this is the end of the road for you.

J: I'm quite fond of beer battered.

N: Oh. {i}Oh{/i}. He chuckles and taps something on the infopad, letting you struggle with your embarrassment in relative privacy for a second or two.

J: You'll be assigned to Agent Frostbite in Environmental Monitoring at our Watchpoint in Antarctica. Hope you packed warm. If not, grab a coat at the commissary. 

N: He considers for a moment.

J: Might want two coats.

N: {i}Antarctica{/i}. {w=0.1}It's already cold enough up here, and they're sending you somewhere even {i}colder{/i}. An involuntary shiver runs down your spine.

J: Environmental Monitoring is our division dedicated to, well, monitoring the environment. They're tasked to stop and, if possible, reverse damage caused to vulnerable ecosystems.

This planet is our home, and we at Overwatch intend on keeping it in one piece for future generations.

N: His words echo the thoughts that get you up in the morning. You feel a spark within you.

P: Sir, I agree! I'm honoured to be placed on this team.

N: For the first time, he looks at you with what could almost be pride. You feel a warmth in your chest, and a determination to not let the Commander down.

He {i}hmm{/i}s for a moment.

J: I'm going to send you straight to the hangar. You're going to want to head out immediately for this -- it's no small deal. I'll get Agent Frostbite to meet you there.

Oh, and...

N: He smirks again.

J: Watch out for Frostbite. She can be... {w=0.1}icy.

N: Oh no. Your first day, and already you've got a job that is {i}no small deal{i}. You're by no means bad at what you do, but they're entrusting you with a great deal of responsibility already.

And a mean boss! What if you screw up? Will this Agent Frostbite just leave you in the icy plains of Antarctica as punishment? 

You shiver again, and not from the cold.

P: Thank...

N: You gulp.

P: Thank you, sir. I'll be on my way.

J: Dismissed. 

N: You salute -- though you're not sure if this is the right time -- and turn on your heels to head back to the hangar. 

Thankfully, you kind of know the route now, and you don't find as many dead ends this time. You pull your coat tighter, and try to not feel anxious about meeting this Agent Frostbite.

TITLE: MEI/DEPLOYMENT ONE/HOPE YOU PACKED WARM

BG: Overwatch hangar (??) && Aircraft interior??

<<bg>> OVERWATCH HANGAR
      
N: The hangar is exactly the same as you left it: cold and mostly empty, a few Overwatch members running to-and-fro with purpose. Some of them are loading the transport you arrived on with scientific equipment you mostly don't recognize. 

As you wait, your mind begins to wander. What food will there be to eat in Antarctica? Fish, maybe. Will Agent Frostbite expect you to eat polar bear?

Wait. {w=0.1}Polar bears aren't even {i}in{/i} Antarctica. Some scientist you are. 

You mentally kick yourself, just as a woman swathed in thick furs strides into the hangar.<meidefault> {w=0.1}Her arms are filled with equipment that looks far more expensive than any paycheck you've ever earned. 

By the way the other Overwatch agents defer to her, you realise this must be Agent Frostbite. {w=0.1}You instantly step towards her to offer help.

P: E-excuse me --

N: At the sound of your voice, Agent Frostbite turns in your direction. You freeze in your steps as she looks you over, waiting for her to deem you unworthy.

P: I'm the new recruit assigned to you, m-ma'am. 

N: You inwardly cringe at your stammering. Surely she will sense your weakness and pounce. 

Her eyes are hidden behind the glare of light across her glasses, but you imagine they're as cold as the air in the hangar.

P: I don't want to assume... but would you like any help carrying anything?

Uh -- Ma'am. Sir. Ma'am.

N: You salute again, then quickly drop your hand and wait for judgment.

Agent Frostbite tilts her head...{w=0.1} and her glasses clear, revealing eyes as warm as the coffee you wish you had in your hands right now.

She breaks into a wide grin.

A: Ah! You are the one helping me! It's good to meet you -- {$playername} is it? I am Mei-Ling Zhou, but you can call me Mei.

M: Oh, but you're trembling! Are you cold? Or...

N: She laughs, and it is one of the cutest sounds you have ever heard. How can someone so cruel sound so sweet? 

M: Did the Commander tell you stories about me? 

N: You nod.

P: Yes, he said you could be, uh, icy?

N: Mei shakes her head, and the pile of electronics in her arms wobbles dangerously.

M: They are all lies. He likes to mess with newbies, like you. I'm nothing like he says, unless he has told you I'm... {w=0.1}a-Mei-zing! 

<meihappy> N: She laughs to herself, and you can't help but chuckle along. 

Word play isn't so bad, you're prone to making a joke or two -- or ten -- yourself sometimes. Your old colleagues once locked you in a lab for it. You never learned. 

<meidefault> M: If you would like to help, you could load these into the transport for me?

N: Mei nods her head to gesture at her load.
