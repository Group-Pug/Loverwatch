BG: Overwatch HQ - outside

N: ... 

You’re still not used to the cruel winds up here.{w=0.5} The gusts come, so bone-chillingly cold that they threaten to freeze you straight to your core if you stick around on this overlook too long.

The altitude is too high,{w=0.2} the sun shines too bright,{w=0.2} and you’re pretty sure that you’ve never had such terribly chapped lips in your entire existence.{w=0.5} {i}Honestly.{/i}

And, yet... {w=0.5} gloved hands gripped to the icy rails, you can’t help but lean forward and feel just the slightest bit in awe when presented with the quiet majesty that is the Overwatch Headquarters.

Drawing in a breath of excitement, you grin outwardly at nothing and everything. The personnel rushing about below, the Overwatch flag flying proudly at full mast.{w=0.5} The promise of a new adventure - and fulfilling a great purpose.

This time has been coming for so long that it’s hard to believe you’re here, {w=0.2}now, {w=0.2}in person and ready to begin your new journey.

A call came in the middle of the night a scant few days ago, a rough-edged voice on the end of the line demanding your name, personnel number and to report at your earliest convenience.

Ever since the establishment of the Overwatch initiative, this has been all you’ve worked towards.{w=0.5} With both of your parents working within the United Nations - in different capacities - you’ve grown up around the ideals of diplomacy and justice.

When the world cried out in pain, Overwatch was there.{w=0.5} When it seemed like the darkness threatened to fall, Overwatch was there.

Heroes seemed to exist once more, and from then on, you {i}knew{/i} you wanted to take up the mantle and be part of it.

Maybe it’s a little righteous to assume that you alone can help enact some change - {w=0.2}after all, you’re fairly sure you’re {i}not{/i} a hero like the ones you’ve seen in the news reports, or overheard talk about at the dinner table.

Really, you’re just a person that’s particularly good at their vocation. {w=0.5}Unlike the legends you’ve admired from afar, you put your pants on one leg at a time like everyone else. {w=0.5}... sometimes, you can even mess that up.

You can’t imagine the showstoppers of Overwatch putting their pants on wrong, in any case.{w=0.5} If they wear pants, that is.

{i}Right. {w=0.2}Enough of that.{/i}

Nerves are making your mind run a mile a minute, thinking over such ridiculous things as {i}pants physics.{/i} A glance at your digital watch tells you it’s almost 1100 hours at the base, and a jolt of anxiety shoots straight through you.

Your assignment meeting is in fifteen minutes with the one-and-only Commander Morrison, and just the thought of a face-to-face with an urban legend you’ve only seen through a screen makes your heart race in your chest.

{i}John Morrison, exemplar soldier, respected leader and incumbent commander of the Overwatch task-force.{/i}

... idly, you feel your hands sweating in your warm gloves even though the air around you is sub-zero. {w=0.2}In fact, you’re uncomfortably hot all over.{w=0.2} {i}Thanks, fight or flight.{/i}

You’ll be fine. Right?

Even though it’s standard procedure for each new member of the task-force to go through the expected bureaucracy of receiving their assignment, there’s so many unknowns that face you.{w=0.2} Who will you be assigned to? {w=0.2}Where will you be deployed?

Will you be headed out to a watchpoint, or will they stick you behind a desk to push papers? Egypt or America? Battlefield or—

{i}Didn’t I just say ‘enough?’{/i}

Sucking in a deep breath, you let go of the rails and take one last look at the icy landscape before you. {w=0.2}This base, these people - this was your home now, and whatever this place throws at you, you’re going to handle. {w=0.2}You can do this.

Time to get to work.

Turning away from the view of the HQ, you rejoin the bustle of the main compound and head to the meeting that’ll end up deciding your future.
